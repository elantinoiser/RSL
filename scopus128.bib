abstract={Historically people traded the risk of living in dangerous places such as volcanic slopes for the benefit of farming in rich soils. Road network around risk prone area plays a key role in saving lives when evacuation is required in an emergency, and thus needs to be in full preparedness to face the eventuality. This will need analysing vulnerability to disruption and identifying critical network links of the evacuation routes. It is also crucial to ensure that the evacuees are aware of recommended routes to sheltered areas. Traffic models to assess road network performance due to natural disasters have been developed in the past. But few researchers investigated whether the evacuees are aware of the recommended routes to sheltered areas and whether they are willing to use them indeed. This paper adopts a vulnerability index and identifies network links to improve, by mapping them to a simple ‘traffic light style’ congestion scale. A special mobile phone application software was developed to guide the residents to reach sheltered areas which takes account of the fact that a third of the residents living around Mt Merapi are not aware of evacuation routes to sheltered areas. © 2020 World Conference on Transport Research Society},

abstract={This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian network model (BNM) to quantitatively evaluate the resilience of urban transportation systems. Based on systemic thinking and taking a sustainability perspective, we investigate the long-term resilience of the road transportation systems in four cities in China from 1998 to 2017, namely Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing, respectively. The model takes into account various factors collected from multi-source data platforms involved in stages of design, construction, operation, management, and innovation in road transportation systems. We test the model with the forward inference, sensitivity analysis, and backward inference. The result shows that the overall resilience scores of all four cities’ transportation systems are within a moderate range with values between 49% to 59%. Although they all have an ever-increasing economic level, the levels of transportation resilience in Beijing and Tianjin decrease first and then gradually increase in a long run, which indicates a strong multi-dimensional, dynamic, and non-linear characteristic in resilience-economic coupling effect. Additionally, the results obtained from the sensitivity analysis and backward inference suggest that decision makers should pay more attention to the capabilities of quickly rebuilding and making changes to cope with future disturbances. As an exploratory study, this study clarifies the concepts of long-term multi-dimensional resilience and specific hazard-related resilience and provides an effective decision-support tool for stakeholders when building resilient infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Climate change is contributing to raising disaster risk, with variable impacts depending on the local level of vulnerability. This paper describes a method for the definition of local vulnerability domains to climate change. The application of the methodology is aimed at building local vulnerability maps. The set of indicators of climate exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, theoretically identified and practically tested on two case studies in southern Italy, contributes to support the territories in identifying the main local vulnerabilities, as well as define, subsequently, a systematic framework for identifying the most suitable mitigation and adaptation measures to climate change according to the specificities of the contexts of interest. In this regard, we consider the framework of risks and related impacts due to climate change on urban infrastructure proposed by the European Commission in order to face common challenges in the EU territories. Specifically, reference is made to three thematic focuses, which are “transport infrastructures”, “energy infrastructures” and “buildings and construction sector”. Although still at an early stage, the results of the research contribute to identifying useful elements of interrelation with the urban context for guiding resilient planning choices and reducing risks. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Having a vulnerability assessment of a large-scale bus transit network (LBTN), an essential part of urban vulnerability assessment, is indispensable for developing urban transportation sustainability. The complex network approach is usually used to realize this goal because it focuses on a mesoscopic perspective and has a unique advantage of calculation efficiency in large-scale networks. However, the vulnerability assessment of LBTNs is usually tested based on node attacks or edge attacks rather than route attacks because of the widely existing “route collinear problem”, which makes the infrastructure disruption and the route service disruption indistinguishable. This paper establishes a novel vulnerability assessment and visualization framework under the perspective of route service disruption. This framework provides a novel perspective for understanding complex systems, lays the foundation for LBTN risk identification, and significantly lowers the availability barrier of the required data, thereby extending the vulnerability study framework based on a complex network approach, from statistical physics to engineering. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Applying a novel approach based on the fusion of social media data, land use data and other information, this paper examines the spatio-temporal patterns of public responses towards urban flooding in Nanjing city during July 1–21, 2016. Spatially, “pockets” of high public concern towards urban flooding were found in areas with low altitude, high percentage of water bodies, and rapid urban construction in recent years. Temporally, public responses tend to peak during the rainstorm period, rather than prior to that. Within a day, behavioural and emotional changes in relation to the rainstorm were most discernable during the morning peak hours. Variations in the response among people of different backgrounds, and the impact of urban flooding on different domains of people's daily life have been revealed. Based on the knowledge gained from this study, policy measures are proposed to increase urban flooding resilience, covering both physical infrastructure and human elements. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented measures changing travel habits in many countries. Many users have started to prefer traveling by private cars, which is against the sustainability policies of the European cities. The necessity of gaining a deeper understanding of road users’ travel habit changes, their feelings on public transport use, and their perceptions of using sustainable urban mobility modes has emerged for future transport planning. Considering these facts, the study in this paper aimed to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on road users’ perceptions, needs, and use of sustainable travel modes (i.e., public transport, walking, and cycling). An online survey was carried out during the period from March to May 2020 in the case study area, Sicily of Southern Italy. Regarding the population of the case study, the survey was representative, with 431 individuals. The survey included variables, namely gender, age, city of residence, private car ownership, walking and cycling frequency before and during the pandemic, public transport use frequency for leisure activities before and during the pandemic, need for remote working, and the stress and anxiety perception of using public transport during the pandemic. The analysis started with descriptive statistics and it was followed by correlation analysis in order to explore the characteristics of the dataset and relationship between variables. It was found that these were not statistically significantly correlated at a 95% confidence level. An ordinal regression model was applied for determining the predictions. The results suggested that women were less likely to walk during the pandemic than men. Participants were more likely to resume remote work even after the second phase in order to reduce their daily travel needs and keep their isolation. Participants have expressed a positive opinion on the use of micromobility during pandemic situations. These results can be considered as a basis for sustainable urban planning and a guide for decision-makers who aim to encourage the use of public transport, walking, cycling, and micromobility. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Due to the lack of ground truth on the link criticality rankings of transportation networks, it is not possible to identify the most accurate metric. While several studies provide reviews of the existing criticality metrics, the consistencies of calculated rankings by these metrics are yet to be explored. In this paper, link criticality rankings with five different metrics are compared under 150 test networks of different network topologies and congestion levels. Accordingly, the consensus metric that provides a ranking that is closest to the aggregate ranking is identified for each test network. The results show transportation network efficiency metric is the most frequent consensus metric and link flow can serve as proxy for criticality analysis under certain network characteristics. The level of congestion and network transitivity are the most important features to determine the consensus metric. The proposed framework is then tested on Sioux Falls, Eastern Massachusetts, and Anaheim networks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Recently, urban agglomerations have become the main platform of China's economic development. As one of those, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) has an important strategic position in national blueprints. Its amazing achievement is inseparable from reliable and resilient transportation networks. With the aim of improving the sustainability of the GBA, this paper presents a novel view of vulnerability and resilience of integrated transportation networks within an urban agglomeration. According to complex network theory, the integrated transportation network model of the GBA was established. Various scenarios were considered to improve the overall level of defensive ability, including random failures, targeted attacks and natural hazards. Vulnerability and resilience assessment models were developed to investigate the influences on the whole network. Finally, a simulation analysis was conducted on the GBA to examine the variations in network performance when faced with different attack scenarios. The results indicate that the transportation network of the GBA is more vulnerable and has less resilience to targeted attacks, while natural hazards had little influence on the performance, to a certain extent. Moreover, the betweenness recovery strategy seemed to be the best choice for every attack scenario. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={This study proposes a series of statistical and regression approaches to investigate city-cluster transport connectivity patterns. Three major city clusters in China are selected for this study, namely, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) economic zones. Our analyses examine three aspects of city-cluster connectivity patterns: (i) connectivity distribution among cities within the city cluster; (ii) dependence of the non-center city on the center city; and (iii) the impact of improved intra-city-cluster rail connectivity on air-connectivity distribution. First, it is found that the BTH has the most concentrated connectivity among the three city clusters, with Beijing clearly dominating the other cities in every kind of connectivity. The connectivity distributions are more balanced in the YRD and PRD. Second, the calculated “survival connectivity” and regression analyses suggest that non-center cities heavily rely on the center city as the hub to develop their network connectivity. Such a “hub-and-spoke system” helps a non-center city improve total connectivity but reduces its direct connectivity to other cities outside the city cluster. Finally, our regression analysis shows that improved intra-city-cluster rail connectivity further deteriorates the air-connectivity disparity within the city cluster, which occurs because the center city benefits more from the upgraded air-HSR (high speed rail) intermodal connectivity because it can attract air passengers from neighboring non-center cities. Relevant policy implications and suggestions are also discussed in the paper. We believe the proposed statistical and regression approaches can be easily applied to examine city-cluster connectivity in other contexts and countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Local or neighborhood roads form the bulk of urban road network and are responsible for the last mile connectivity. They are highly vulnerable to earthquake-like hazards, causing road closures of magnitude ranging from small traffic diversions to isolation of entire neighborhoods. Such disruptions impede the emergency response, and significantly affect the post-disaster recovery. Hence their design, construction, and maintenance are of utmost importance for efficient working of transportation systems. In this article, we study the accessibility of local roads based on intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of vulnerability with a focus on Indian cities. The methodology divides the road network into two components. The first one is the inaccessible stretch of the road network due to its width (Intrinsic Vulnerability), and the second one is the accessible stretch of the road network prone to road closures due to collapsed buildings (Extrinsic vulnerability). Then a three-step framework, namely road network inventory development, building vulnerability assessment, and road closure analysis, is proposed for vulnerability assessment. For this purpose, 77 km of road network and 612 buildings are studied in three selected wards of Siliguri Municipal Corporation (Seismic zone IV). A comparative analysis between the wards for the change in accessibility levels before and after an earthquake is done. The results are measures of inaccessibility in the road network, which are also visualized as isolated streets on the maps. The proposed framework aides an urban planner and an emergency manager to identify the vulnerable parts of road network and take necessary mitigative measures. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Resilience has gained importance in the current research and policy agendas as it incorporates concepts of adaptation and transformation. Urban areas are complex systems exposed to different shocks, which have impacts on its various components. Research in transport has already incorporated the concept of resilience with more or less sophisticated approaches that are intensive on data and technical expertise. There is a need to explore the incorporation of resilience in simpler and less data intensive methods that can be easily applied in a wider range of contexts. One of the aims of this research is to develop a method that can use commonly available mobility management tools allowing smaller urban areas to analyse and plan for resilience. We present a new development of a method to assess resilience in transport systems with a commonly used mobility management tool (the origin-destination matrix) for calculating an overall measurement of resilience. The method assumes that car trips are transferred to active modes or to the available public transport routes in the event of any disruption in the system. We consider different scenarios of availability of public transport in case of disruptive events. We applied the method to two urban areas in Brazil. The variation of the contribution of the public transport presents patterns comparable between the two cases. The spatial distribution of trips shows the relative importance of resilient trips and the cities’ spatial structure. The inclusion of public transport routes has an impact on the levels of accessibility of lower income users. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={One of the main challenges facing transit agencies is offering reliable service with minimum number of interruptions and ensuing delays. Although this issue has recently emerged as a top priority in many cities to ensure sustainable social and environmental progress, there has been little research effort to investigate issues surrounding service disruption. As a response to this gap, this study aims at understanding the impact of outdoor track segments (or open-air sectors) of the metro system and weather conditions on the number of service interruptions and the magnitude of resulting delays at the stop level. The study uses detailed metro system interruption data collected in 2013 by the TTC, the public transit provider in the City of Toronto, Canada. Descriptive statistics and statistical models are developed for the purpose of the study. The empirical investigation reveals that outdoor tracks have a statistically significant association with metro system’s service interruptions. Longer outdoor track distances are linked to both higher frequencies and delays of service interruptions. Weather conditions, in terms of the amount of snow on the ground and rainfall interactions with outdoor tracks, have also a significant association with the frequency and duration of service interruptions. The paper results provide policy makers and planners with useful policy-relevant information related to the impact of outdoor tracks and weather conditions on the metro system interruptions that could be used to support higher capital investments when planning rail transit systems to achieve the system resilience. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Flooding events can produce significant disturbances in underground transport systems within urban areas and lead to economic and technical consequences, which can be worsened by variations in the occurrence of climate extremes. Within the framework of the European project RESCCUE (RESilience to cope with Climate Change in Urban arEas-a multi-sectorial approach focusing on water), climate projections for the city of Barcelona manifest meaningful increases in maximum rainfall intensities for the 2100 horizon. A better comprehension of these impacts and their conditions is consequently needed. A hydrodynamic modelling process was carried out on Barcelona Metro Line 3, as it was identified as vulnerable to pluvial flooding events. The Metro line and all its components are simulated in the urban drainage models as a system of computational link and nodes reproducing the main physical characteristics like slopes and cross-sections when embedded in the current 1D/2D hydrodynamic model of Barcelona used in the project RESCCUE. This study presents a risk analysis focused on ensuring transport service continuity in flood events. The results reveal that two of the 26 stations on Metro Line 3 are exposed to a high risk of flooding in current rainfall conditions, and 11 of the 26 stations on Metro Line 3 are exposed to a high risk of flooding in future rainfall conditions for a 20-year return period event, which affects Metro service in terms of increased risk. This research gives insights for stakeholders and policymakers to enhance urban flood risk management, as a reasonable approach to tackle this issue for Metro systems worldwide. This study provides a baseline for assessing potential flood outcomes in Metro systems and can be used to evaluate adaptation measures' effectiveness. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Accessibility is a key concept in the field of transportation, and there is a rich amount of reviews available on this topic which concentrate on certain perspectives. However, none of them presents a comprehensive and quantitative overview on accessibility-related publications. To fill this gap, this study reviewed two decades of publications (during 2000–2019) drawn from Web of Science (WoS), and aims to figure out the evolution pathway of accessibility related studies so that future research directions can be recognized. By employing the bibliometric analysis techniques, this study provides the potential to trace historical and geographic trends at global level, covering leading journals and institutions, keywords characteristics, citation network analysis, and a qualitative review of the most influential papers. The output results show that there is an increasing geographic spread along with the growth spurt of research publications on the topic of accessibility especially since 2010s. Both the keywords' characteristics and citation network analysis help to identify research hot points, categorized as new indicators development and accessibility-based applications. Finally, this paper highlights the need for further studies for those two hot points respectively. It is hoped the results output here could benefit researchers engaging in this field to sharpen their own future research directions, and provide practitioners with a greater understanding of the various types of accessibility metrics and help them to identify the most appropriate practice for their specific situation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The increased severe weather events in recent years as a result of global climate change has created a substantial challenge for aviation system operation. Although transportation engineers and planners have attempted to improve system resilience through the adaptation of new technologies and the implementation of various strategies to achieve effective risk management, it remains unclear how resilience performance (measured by the speed of recovery) of airports varies in different severe weather events and what factors may explain such variations. This paper addresses these fundamental questions using the aviation system in China as an example. A resilience metric, which reflects the speed of recovery (bounce back) from a shock, was developed to measure the performance of airport resilience under various severe weather conditions. In addition, an empirical econometric analysis was conducted based on a dataset that includes both detailed aviation performance and weather conditions for the period of October 2016 – September 2017. The research findings show that airport resilience to severe weather events does vary substantially based on factors, such as weather conditions, airport capacity, and the level of modal substitution. In particular, the recovery time of air services in central and south China tends to be relatively longer in thunderstorms than other weather conditions. The study also confirms that modal substitution is a very effective resilience tactic of the transportation system as the recovery speed of air service was found to be faster by 22.9% if an alternative mode, such as high-speed rail (HSR) service was also available in the city. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Transportation system infrastructure often experiences severe flood-related disruptions such as overtopping, erosion, and scour. The ensuing damages can result in enormous direct and indirect economic losses to the traffic network and consequently the individuals through conditions like inaccessibility to commuters and reduction in traffic safety. Many studies have claimed that a robust transportation system could significantly prevent such consequences from natural hazards such as floods, highlighting the importance of robustness measures that could be used by decision-makers to properly manage flooded transportation system. Most available measures related to network robustness assessment are qualitative, and while some recent studies have focused on such evaluation using quantitative assessment approaches related to environmental or social-economic operations, they lack the holistic view towards robustness under flood events. This study develops a composite multi-scale transportation-system robustness model considering flood hazards by synthesizing geographical damage recognition, topological functionality analysis, network operation evaluation, and traffic-user loss estimation. This integrated model has been applied in a real-world highway network, mainly revealing that a given intensive flood occurrence at different locations may result in a variety of after-flood disruptions in the transportation network. To assist the asset owners with developing more reasonable prevention and recovery plans, the developed multi-scale robustness index presents both visible multi-denominational flood consequences and an overall post-event transportation-system robustness indicator. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Resilience offers a broad social-technical framework to deal with breakdown, response and recovery of transportation networks adapting to various disruptions. Although current research works model and simulate transportation resilience from different perspectives, the real-world resilience of urban road network is still unclear. In this paper, a novel end to end deep learning framework is proposed to estimate and predict the spatiotemporal patterns of transportation resilience under extreme weather events. Diffusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and a dynamic-capturing algorithm of transportation resilience jointly form the backbone of this framework. The presented framework can capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of urban road network and evaluate transportation resilience based on real-world big data, including on-demand ride services data provided by DiDi Chuxing and grid meteorological data. Results show that aggregate data of related precipitation events could be used for transportation resilience modeling under extreme weather events when facing sample imbalance problem due to limited historical disaster data. In terms of observed transportation resilience, transportation network demonstrates different characteristics between sparse network and dense network, as well as general precipitation events and extreme weather events. The response time is double or triple of the recovery time, and an elastic limit exists in the recovery process of network resilience. In terms of resilience prediction, the proposed model outperforms competitors by incorporating topological information and has better predictions of the system performance degradation than other resilience indices. The above results could assist researchers and policy makers clearly understand the real-world resilience of urban road networks in both theory and practice, and take effective responses under emergent disruptive events. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={To evaluate the travel reliability of an urban rail transit (URT) in normal operation, three travel reliability indicators are proposed from passengers' travel. The connectivity reliability, travel time reliability, and capacity reliability indicators are computed from the weighted average of the number of tolerable travel paths, the ratios of 95-50 quantiles of travel times, and effective residual capacity coefficients between pairs of stations, respectively. The weight of an origin-destination (OD) station pair in a certain time period is the ratio of the passenger trips of this station pair to the passenger trips entering the origin station during that period. The tolerable coefficient, which is the ratio of passengers' tolerable travel time to shortest possible travel time, is proposed to determine the tolerable travel paths. The effective residual capacity coefficient between an OD station pair is calculated with residual capacities and capacities of all tolerable paths between them. The travel reliability indicators are used to evaluate the travel reliability of Chengdu's URT stations and network during different time periods and for different tolerable coefficients. The correlations among the travel reliability indicators of stations are analyzed. The results show the travel reliability of a URT in different time periods and indicate how that reliability is related to the tolerable coefficient. A station with better connectivity reliability often has higher capacity reliability also. Because passengers may choose different tolerable travel paths when multiple tolerable travel paths exist between station pairs, a station with high connectivity reliability may correspond to low travel time reliability. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Climate change poses critical challenges for rail infrastructure and operations. However, the systematic analysis of climate risks and the associated costs of tackling them, particularly from a quantitative perspective, is still at an embryonic phase due to the kaleidoscopic nature of climate change impacts and lack of precise climatic data. To cope with such challenges, an advanced Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR) model is applied in this paper to understand climate threats of the railway system. This model ranks climate risks under high uncertainty in data and comprehensively evaluates these risks by taking account of infrastructure resilience and specific aspects of severity of consequence. Through conducting a nationwide survey on the British railway system, it dissects the status quo of primary climate risks. The survey implies that the top potential climate threats are heavy precipitation and floods. The primary risks caused by the climate threats are bridges collapsing and bridge foundation damage due to flooding and landslips. The findings can aid transport planners to prioritise climate risks and develop rational adaptation measures and strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Urban transportation systems are susceptible to disturbances, interruptions, and risks from natural and human causes. The concept of resilience has been introduced into urban transportation systems to reduce the consequences of its disruptions. Recently, this concept has attracted considerable interest from researchers from different areas of transportation and mobility. However, several investigations about this issue were carried out under different perspectives, resulting in a more comprehensive concept, which includes adapting and transforming systems for different levels of equilibrium. This article provides a thorough and conceptual review of resilience applied to urban transportation systems focusing on its definitions, characteristics, and quantification methods. Based on this, the evaluation of the level of resilience of mobility subsystems is discussed to provide the basic framework for generating a tool to assess the resilience of the urban transportation system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Resilience comprehensively describes the ability of a roadway system to absorb and recover from a disruptive event. The existing resilience metrics can be improved to measure the system performance more accurately and the impact of traffic flow should be considered in the evaluation. This study first examined the roadway capacity degradation and recovery processes, then used the network efficiency as a measure of system performance to develop a resilience metric for the entire disruptive event duration period. The study proposed the resilience achievement worth (RAW) and resilience reduction worth (RRW) indices to reflect the link importance respectively from the optimistic and pessimistic perspectives, and the heuristic algorithm was used to identify the importance degrees of roadway links. The results from the examples show that the proposed resilience metric is able to measure the average cumulative performance of the roadway system during the entire degradation and recovery processes after a disruptive event, which is more consistent with the function of resilience metric. The indices of RAW and RRW are also able to effectively identify the link importance degree. The importance degrees of most of the roadway links change dynamically with time.

abstract={Although companies are decisive in contributing to urban resilience, unresolved questions remain about which practices they can implement. Considering that the concept of resilience is acknowledged both explicitly and implicitly in a range of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), this research aims to fill the existing gap between theoretical considerations about the role of companies in fostering urban resilience and the practices they implement and disclose. First, we build a theoretical framework based on strategic and instrumental components that can support the contribution of companies to urban resilience. Subsequently, we analyze 138 sustainability reports from organizations operating in Italy and Japan to identify how the SDGs, in particular those targets concerning environmental and social resilience, are implemented in their activities and communicated in their nonfinancial reports. Because greater attention to disclosures on the impacts of companies on resilience is a starting point for action towards achieving the SDGs, this study provides new insights into the contribution of companies to the resilience of cities, thus advancing the literature on the link between business and urban resilience. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

funding_text 1={This section illustrates the main findings of our study, with particular reference to the role of collaborations in achieving urban resilience. By analyzing the reports of 138 organizations operating in countries with high hydrogeological risk (i.e. Italy and Japan), we identify how the SDGs are implemented in their activities and are communicated in their nonfinancial disclosures. In particular, we focus on strategic and instrumental components ( Jabareen, 2013 ; Ahern, 2013 ) to understand whether and how companies contribute to resilience implementation. Table 1 provides an overview of the adoption rate for strategic and instrumental components, segmented for Italy, Japan and the totality of the companies included in the sample. The first significant evidence that emerges from the analysis is that governance, prevention and biodiversity are the components that companies mainly address in their non-financial disclosure. Meanwhile, companies provide little information about their implementation of multifunctionality and modularization components. In almost all cases, Italian and Japanese companies report information about their contribution to resilience with the almost same ratio. Only three cases (biodiversity, connectivity and uncertainty) reveal an evident difference in companies’ disclosure. a) Biodiversity Strategies that support biodiversity are the main strategies that companies address in their reports (62% of the sample), with the majority belonging to high environmental risk industries such as mining, cement or energy. The spread of the biodiversity issue in company reports is probably due to its explicit inclusion in SDG #15, which aims to “protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss,” and in six GRI indicators (from EN9 to EN14). Companies make disclosures about biodiversity in terms of risk and impact limitation, impact measurement and monitoring, and the restoration of pre-existing conditions at the end of activities. Some companies recognize all of these biodiversity approaches and embed biodiversity considerations into internal management processes and strategic decision making. For example, Japan Tobacco underlines how responsible management of biodiversity within operations supports the long-term viability of its business, while protecting the environment. “This involves assessing our dependence and impact on biodiversity and natural resources and identifying how we utilize and manage these. We then deploy appropriate responses, such as good agricultural practices, initiatives on soil management, sustainable wood and water conservation, and natural forest restoration. In 2017, we launched our project on nature restoration in Brazil. This was in collaboration with the Society for Wildlife Research and Environmental Education and approved by the National Bank for Social Economic Development. Over the next five years, the project aims to restore 335 ha of Permanent Protection Areas at our integrated tobacco farms as well as in Flona de Irati, a National Forestry Reserve”. “Biodiversity”, Japan Tobacco 2017 Sustainability report, p. 55 Although the importance of biodiversity is well recognized, companies declare their efforts to foster biodiversity but do not often explain what activities they implement when referring to this aim. However, there are exceptions, with some organizations accurately indicating their practices and publishing ad hoc policies on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Buzzi Unicem's report reads as follows. “ Buzzi Unicem is committed to protecting natural resources impacted by its industrial activities . The main goal of mitigation is to restore previously existing biodiversity by adopting a model grounded on the following principles : optimizing the use of resources and incentivizing the use of secondary raw materials ; conducting preliminary assessment of environmental impacts and minimizing them during the life cycle of the extraction activity ; preparing a planting plan consistent with the area's rehabilitation project right from the start ; legal compliance must be the minimum requirement when establishing each quarry rehabilitation plan ; involving stakeholders through transparency , discussion and evaluation of needs of territory and local communities ; considering initiatives on biodiversity .” “Environmental performance”, Buzzi Unicem 2016 Sustainability report, p. 60 Since the properties of companies often include areas that are commercially productive (such as mineral sites or cultivated areas) it is important that they take actions to influence how such areas are managed and collaborate with institutions to mitigate their environmental impacts of their activities. The need for collaboration with institutions and research centers emerges in some cases. Costa Cruises affirms as follows: “ Costa Cruises has always been at the forefront of scientific research efforts , projects and partnerships aimed at protecting the sea . Our alliances with the CNR11 and , more particularly , with ISMAR12 are examples of the way in which we contribute to activities designed to study and monitor the state of health of the marine environment .” “The environment our earth, our home”, Costa Cruises 2016 Sustainability report, p. 60 b) Urban connectivity Because urban connectivity is highly developed for connectivity-dependent functions, industries such as communication and energy distribution play a fundamental role in its implementation and are included in 22% of companies that consider urban connectivity in their non-financial disclosures. The reports reveal that urban connectivity mainly refers to physical connectivity (e.g. transportation) and information connectivity. According to SDG #11, urban connectivity includes the adoption of sustainable transport, which is useful for achieving a “better integration of the economy while respecting the environment. improving social equity, health, resilience of cities, urban-rural linkages and productivity of rural areas”. For example, the inclusion of road works in the natural and urban environment generates a set of effects and environmental impacts on the territory, influencing and altering landscapes and various ecosystems. On the other hand, maximizing urban connectivity can provide benefits in terms of the movement of people and species. Companies operating in transportation, communication, and energy distribution industries could emphasize their role in fostering resilience through the spatial connection of urban areas. However, they do not explicitly link their activities to the improvement of resilience; rather, companies limit their reports to explain how connections are implemented with respect to the ecosystem, as the following excerpt from the sustainability report of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane illustrates: “ Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane takes on the role of gateway to the mobility ecosystem , in an integrated perspective , in a sustainable way , avoiding the construction of unnecessary infrastructures and not involving protected areas ; reducing impacts to a minimum , where it is not possible to prevent them , with appropriate measures ( underpasses , overpasses , fences ); restoring the overall value of biodiversity lost due to the construction of the infrastructure .” “Territory protection”, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane 2016 Sustainability report, p. 176 Information connectivity is resilient when can connect people even though difficult circumstance. KDDI explains its contribution to urban connectivity as follows: “KDDI is aware of the role of communications as a vital lifeline service. We are implementing various measures to ensure that we can maintain reliable communication services at all times under any circumstances. At times of disasters, we prioritize the maintenance and speedy restoration of communication services and install public wireless LAN and charging facilities at evacuation centers”. “Disaster Relief & Support”, KDDI 2017 Sustainability report c) Multifunctionality Companies disclose their beneficial impacts on territories across production, ecological, and cultural dimensions, without referring to the term “multifunctionality” (we count only 4 companies in the sample that cited this strategy). However, companies underline the multiple roles of their activities in affecting the environment and society. In line with the literature, this aspect has been highlighted by organizations that are active in the agri-food industry. Combining agricultural activities with the maintenance of biodiversity, cultural ecosystem services, recreation, integration, social sustainability and social cohesion, agri-food companies contribute to fostering resilience. Fruttagel's report indicates the implementation of multifunctionality, enhancing four main aspects of the impact of its activities: the environment, nutrition, the economy, and culture. Thus, the company lists objectives that refer to each aspect and underlines the critical role of urban institutions in pursuing these objectives. “ Following sustainable agricultural practices ; encouraging resilience production systems ; developing and maintain diversity ; promoting different varieties of food ; producing nutrient foods ; promoting self-sufficiency through local productions ; strengthen local food systems (…)”. “Quality, food safety and innovation”, Fruttagel 2016 Sustainability report, p. 54. d) Modularization Modularization implies that system components have enough independence that damage to or the failure of one part or component of a system will, by design, have a low probability of inducing the failure of other similar or related components in the system. Modular design is also used to solve service provision problems in remote locations and hostile urban environments. Moreover, a consistently implemented modularization makes possible versatile production processes, cost reductions, efficiency gains and considerable versatility. Cities that are served by modular and interconnected systems (e.g., power, water, transportation, health) are consequently less vulnerable to extreme events than are cities that are wholly dependent on one single central system, with few options in the event of a failure. Thus, companies adopt a modular approach to be resilient in the case of damage. Only a few companies (2%) illustrate this aspect in their report, probably because of the complexity of explaining modularization. No Japanese companies disclosed about modularization. Energy industry companies, for example, modularize their infrastructure to cover the whole population of the territory and to provide energy in the case of electrical overloads. “ In December 2015 the Municipality of Milan and A2A announced an extraordinary four-year plan to improve the resilience of the electricity grid in the most critical areas of the city , so as to support any exceptional electrical loads , for a total investment of 13 million euros ”. “Manufacturing capital”, A2A 2016 Integrated report, p. 58 Modularization of system components can regard not only physical infrastructures used in the regular activities of organizations, but also organizational units created for handling emergencies. JXTG, depending on the magnitude of the emergency, establishes an Emergency Headquarters or a Joint Emergency Headquarters with Group companies to ensure swift and appropriate response to the crisis in order to fulfill the social mission of the Group. In this case, modularization of emergency managerial structures enables the company to address catastrophic events that can happens in dislocated areas. However, emergency systems include also modularization of physical components, as emerges from the report of JXTG: “We regularly implement comprehensive disaster drills for our own disaster response organizations to ensure that we can respond in a quick and agile manner should an actual disaster occur. We also hold other drills, including joint disaster preparedness drills involving local fire departments and disaster response organizations from nearby companies”. “Measures to Cope with Accidents and Problems”, JXTG 2017 CSR report, p. 51 e) Adaptive design Adaptive design is the basis for the operationalization of urban resilience, highlighting the need to actively solve problems collaboratively by exercising imagination and creativity and presenting new and potentially fertile sources of innovation. In this vein, social resilience thinking creates opportunities for innovation and development, going beyond the capacity to absorb shock and retain core functions to embrace the potential for renewal and development. In communicating their adaptive design practices, companies refer to SDG #13, which calls for companies to make efforts to redress climate change through both adaptation and mitigation that are able to similarly inform and shape the global development agenda. The 15 companies in the sample that make disclosures about the implementation of adaptive design adopt two different acceptations. First, they refer to adaptive design management and policy development in collaboration with institutions. TIM, for instance, provides a summary of the initiatives implemented in partnership with several stakeholders, indicating the established object, the actions carried out, and the partner is collaborating with. An initiative that considers resiliency and concerns the design of its structures is described as follows: “In order to prevent or limit the potential damage, TIM's new exchanges and buildings are built at a safe distance from rivers and bodies of water in general and, in order to ensure continuity of service, the network is designed considering appropriate levels of resilience and redundancy”. “Climate change”, TIM 2017 Sustainability report, p. 52 Second, they refer to the design of their structures and products to guarantee resilience and safety. For example, Mazda innovatively designs its production to protect human safety on the road and to prevent connectivity congestion. “Traffic accidents and congestion are serious social problems in many countries and cities. To solve these problems, worldwide efforts have been taken to introduce advanced technologies for roads and automobiles. As an automobile manufacturer, Mazda has been proactively supporting the ITS project and working collaboratively with the government, local communities, and related companies in order to realize a society where the road traffic is safe and accident-free”. “Safety”, Mazda 2017 Sustainability report, p. 52 f) Vulnerability According to the literature, companies try to reduce the vulnerability of urban territories by implementing a risk management program that limits and avoids partial risk and shares unavoidable risks with other parties. In general, the 28 companies that include vulnerability in their reports refer to three typologies of risk in their reports. They recognize information resilience vulnerability and protect their information assets from risks such as cyberattacks, leakages or disasters, adopting information management systems. Other companies address social resilience vulnerability by addressing human rights risks in the supply chain, such as modern slavery and conflict minerals. Some companies focus on environmental vulnerability, reducing water usage by promoting various water conservation and water leakage prevention measures as well as reducing CO2 emissions by changing the heat source for producing water to a source of surplus electric power at power plants. In this regard, companies refer to SDG #1, which highlights the need to “build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.” The reduction of these risks implies the creation of proper efficient infrastructures that protect urban vulnerabilities. “ The Group adopts procedures , behaviours , technology and in- vestments to guarantee the latest and best possible standards . The celebration of 10 years of operation of the constitution of the Consulta per la Sicurezza e la Qualità del Servizio ( Council Constitution for Safety and Service Quality ), an initiative promoted in 2005 to foster collaboration between Autostrade per l'Italia , consumer associations , institutions and economic operators ( Codacons , Adusbef , Federconsumatori and Adoc , the Police , Adiconsum , Asaps , Isoradio ”. “Social capital”, Atlantia 2016 Integrated report, p. 76 Other companies analyze the risks for each aspect included in GRI guidelines and the impact they would have on the company and the territory. Casio discloses a table in its CSR report where the company discusses the management of risks associated to different aspects of its activity (corruption, information security, supply chain, social and environmental issues among others). Casio clearly describes the tasks of the CSR office manager that addresses social resilience vulnerability. “ He [ the CSR office manager ] explained the potential for serious business and credit risk arising from any improper protection of worker rights and presented specific examples of human rights issues to be looked at in the supply chain . The aim was to promote through understanding of the importance of taking steps to protect human rights ”. “Responsibilities to suppliers”, Casio 2017 Sustainability report, p. 97 g) Prevention The prevention approach is expressed by the majority of reports (93% of the sample), which highlight that the prediction and prevention of a risk (ex-ante intervention) are better than its remediation (ex post intervention). Contributing to urban resilience through prevention implies two main activities of companies within a territory: informative prevention and structural prevention. The latter enables companies to internally implement their systems in preparation for future possible disasters. Ordinary infrastructure monitoring also enables companies to identify losses or malfunctions more quickly, significantly improving their performance. For example, Nissan declares to help address a range of issues towards the realization of a society with less urban traffic congestion and more ways for older citizens to move about safely. “ Nissan is enhancing its preventive safety technologies to support the four basic steps in avoiding accidents : sensing , cognition , judgment and action […] In a society facing issues including aging populations and urban congestion , autonomous driving technologies may one day be able to help reduce traffic accidents , thus providing peace of mind to drivers and increasing mobility for the rapidly growing number of senior citizens ”. “Safety”, Nissan 2017 Sustainability report, p. 51 Informative prevention consists of informing and educating the population about eventual risks and is mainly directed towards consumers and employees. Some companies decide to safeguard the territory through awareness campaigns for a responsible use of their products. Others work on fundamental issues such as the circular economy, urban regeneration, land security, seismic prevention and intelligent city development. An example is provided below by Enel: “ Enel and ANCI ( National Association of Italian Municipalities ) signed a protocol to increase the awareness of Italian institutions and operators about the themes and investments to make Italian cities more resilient , putting its experience and skills at the service of the country . In particular , Enel and ANCI undertook to stimulate the adhesion of Italian cities to the campaign of the United Nations “ Making Cities Resilient ”, acknowledging that mayors have a key role for the development of the local area and as a driver for the implementation of operational plans . During 2016 , with the collaboration of the regional European office of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction ( UNISDR ) a training module was drawn up on resilience , with a specific focus on strategic and operational impacts . The program , which is included in the MBA courses and PhDs of leading Italian universities , saw the participation of over 120 people .” “Our commitment”, Enel 2016 Sustainability report, p. 110 h) Governance Formulating policy and appropriate governance structures can enable, accommodate and facilitate companies in positively affecting urban resilience. The structure and mission of corporate governance are widely addressed by companies in their responsibility reports (94% of the sample). Indeed, governance plays a critical role in creating strategies and plans that aim to achieve the SDGs. The open dialogue between companies’ governance and several internal and/or external stakeholders - in a few cases even their inclusion in decision-making - is a useful instrument to improve urban resilience. For example, gradual consultation with senior management and the main areas of companies stimulates constructive dialogue concerning the strategic direction of future sustainability efforts and the definition of sustainability policies in line with the SDGs. Companies recognize that the development of policies in line with the SDGs allows them to understand the contribution of their activities and to acknowledge how the private sector can have a central role as an agent of change in facing major global challenges. In particular, good governance and dialogue with different stakeholders is helpful in achieving SDGs #5, #9, #11 and #16. “ Governance ( ESG ) criteria has been adopted as a major indicator of corporate value . In particular , the number of opportunities has risen to respond to requests from our customers to confirm how we are responding to the needs of people and society at large within our activities in the B-to-B sphere and transactions with governmental and municipal entities , which we are working to strengthen .” “Message from management”, Canon 2017 Sustainability report, p. 4 The inclusion of resilience and sustainability in the main mission of companies enhances their efforts to achieve SDGs and the priority the give to realizing such goals. For example, Banca Intesa highlights its strong commitment to building resilient infrastructures, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation as well as making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. “The growth strategy of the Bank strives to create stable and sustainable values from the economic, financial, social and environmental aspect, building on the fundamental corporate values of the Bank in relations with all stakeholders”. “Bank profile”, Banca Intesa 2017 Sustainability report, p. 10 i) Uncertainty orientation To adopt an uncertainty approach, however, companies try to define the conditions under which a disaster would occur and what factors would affect current conditions. Companies also engineer systems to avoid or survive disasters. We identify three main uncertainty issues that 35% of the companies declare that they must address. First, uncertainty is associated with the policy environment. This uncertainty refers to regulatory instability that belongs to the external environment (institutional policy) or the internal environment (corporate policy). Policy uncertainty due to the external environment is difficult to control – although it is a little easier to predict. Internal policy uncertainty can be addressed by companies through effective policy designs. Second, uncertainty is linked to the natural environment, which can provoke unexpected contingencies that affect the resilience of cities and their citizens. In this case, climate change can directly affect not only physical structures but also the resilience of business, as shown in the Sustainability reports of ENI and other companies within the insurance and bank industries. A number of international organizations (particularly UNEP, the European Union and the OECD), have recognized and often emphasized the important role that insurance and banking can play in the fight against climate change, especially in terms of the prevention and management of associated risks, by creating and conceptualizing new products and services, as well as making long-term investments intended to increase the resilience of residents, businesses and communities. Companies express their awareness of the unanticipated scenarios that climate change or earthquakes can cause, limiting the effectiveness of current policy responses. However, they try to reduce uncertainty as much as possible through “resilient” strategies. “ Climate change risk identifies the possibility of changes occurring to aspects associated with climate change which may generate , in the short , medium and long term , physical and other risks which impact on the business . The risks and opportunities associated with climate change , analysed particularly with regard to the four-year strategic plan and over the long term , concern : Extreme/chronic weather and climate phenomena with a possible increase in costs ( including insurance ) for adaptation measures to protect assets and people , Uncertainty over the evolution of the energy mix and hydrocarbon prices in a low-carbon context , with effects on the demand for fossil fuels , on project operating costs and profitability or Speed of development of low-carbon technological solutions and consequent uncertainty regarding the effects on business ”. “Path to decarbonization”, Eni Spa 2016 Sustainability report, p. 13–14 Third, uncertainty can include the infrastructures of companies and their efficiency in contributing to urban resilience. In this regard, the involvement of concerned parties in the planning processes and in the development of infrastructure is an essential element to monitor and control uncertain events and consequences. summarizes the strategic components and instruments that the academic literature suggests to institutions and organizations for the implementation of urban resilience as well as the role that companies can play, as it emerges from the content analysis of their non-financial disclosure. Thus, the table shows a synoptic overview of the strategic and instrumental components of resilience planning, providing a definition for each element, describing its impact on cities, and suggesting the contribution of companies to urban resilience achievement.

abstract={Vehicle mobility generates dynamic and complex patterns that are associated with our day-to-day activities in cities. To reveal the spatial-temporal complexity of such patterns, digital techniques, such as traffic-monitoring sensors, provide promising data-driven tools for city managers and urban planners. Although a large number of studies have been dedicated to investigating the sensing power of the traffic-monitoring sensors, there is still a lack of exploration of the resilient performance of sensor networks when multiple sensor failures occur. In this paper, we reveal the dynamic patterns of vehicle mobility in Cambridge, UK, and subsequently, explore the resilience of the sensor networks. The observability is adopted as the overall performance indicator to depict the maximum number of vehicles captured by the deployed sensors in the study area. By aggregating the sensor networks according to weekday and weekend and simulating random sensor failures with different recovery strategies, we found that (1) the day-to-day vehicle mobility pattern in this case study is highly dynamic and decomposed journey durations follow a power-law distribution on the tail section; (2) such temporal variation significantly affects the observability of the sensor network, causing its overall resilience to vary with different recovery strategies. The simulation results further suggest that a corresponding prioritization for recovering the sensors from massive failures is required, rather than a static sequence determined by the first-fail-first-repair principle. For stakeholders and decision-makers, this study provides insightful implications for understanding city-scale vehicle mobility and the resilience of traffic-monitoring sensor networks. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Whereas the importance of transportation for economic growth is widely acknowledged, past studies on the resilience of regions to economic shocks have not given explicit attention to the role of transportation accessibility on building robust regional economies. This exploratory study examines the regional performance in six U.S. states during the last recession (2008–2009) and post-recession (2010–2014) and evaluates its association with the transportation infrastructure. To account for spatial dependence and interactions, a exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), a global spatial autoregressive model, and a local Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) are employed. Results show that, after controlling for other key aspects of resilience, such as industrial diversity and human capital, the global relationships between rail density, access to intermodal services, and access to local and regional markets were positively associated with regional performance (measured as competitive effect) during the recession. Similarly, positive regional performance before the recession period was associated with positive performance during the recession. The local spatial analysis, however, shows that the associations between the explanatory variables and regional performance vary significantly across space. The analysis and results of this study can contribute to a better understanding of the complex interactions between economic resilience and transportation infrastructure, and guide the development of policies and practices designed to strengthen the ability of regions to be resilient to economic shocks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Transport network criticality analysis aims at ranking transport infrastructure elements based on their contribution to the performance of the overall infrastructure network. Despite the wide variety of transport network criticality metrics, little guidance is available on selecting metrics that are fit for the specific purpose of a study. To address this gap, this study reviews, evaluates and compares seventeen criticality metrics. First, we conceptually evaluate these metrics in terms of the functionality of the transport system that the metrics try to represent (either maintaining connectivity, reducing travel cost, or improving accessibility), the underlying ethical principles (either utilitarianism or egalitarianism), and the spatial aggregation considered by the metrics (either network-wide or localised). Next, we empirically compare the metrics by calculating them for eight transport networks. We define the empirical similarity between two metrics as the degree to which they yield similar rankings of infrastructure elements. Pairs of metrics that have high empirical similarity highlight the same set of transport infrastructure elements as critical. We find that empirical similarity is partly dependent on the network’s topology. We also observe that metrics that are conceptually similar do not necessarily have high empirical similarity. Based on the insights from the conceptual and empirical comparison, we propose a five-step guideline for transport authorities and analysts to identify the set of criticality metrics to use which best aligns with the nature of their policy questions. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={This paper outlines the work carried out within the RESCCUE (RESilience to cope with Climate Change in Urban ArEas) project that is, in part, examining the impacts of climate-driven hazards on critical services and infrastructures within cities. In this paper, we examined the methods employed to assess the impacts of pluvial flooding events for varying return periods for present-day (Baseline) and future Climate Change with no adaptation measures applied (Business as Usual) conditions on traffic flows within cities. Two cities were selected, Barcelona and Bristol, with the former using a meso-scale and the latter a micro-scale traffic model. The results show how as the severity of flooding increases the disruption/impacts on traffic flows increase and how the effects of climate change will increase these impacts accordingly. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Under the background of urbanization and the rapid development of urban rail transit (URT), serious attention has been focused on URT network reliability in recent years. In this work, in order to measure network reliability, three indicators are constructed based on passengers’ tolerable travel paths, passenger travel efficiency and passenger travel realization on a URT network. The passenger tolerability coefficient, which is the ratio of passengers’ tolerable travel time to the shortest possible travel time, is proposed and added to the indicators. It reflects passengers’ behavior with respect to choice of travel paths. The ratio of affected passenger volume (RAPV) is proposed to identify important stations. Finally, the connectivity reliability of Wuhan’s subway network is analyzed by simulating attacks on stations. The results show that the degree centrality, betweenness centrality and RAPV indicators of stations can effectively identify the important stations that have a significant impact on the connectivity reliability of the network. In particular, the RAPV indicator effectively identifies stations that have the greatest influence on passenger travel realization. The connectivity reliability of Wuhan’s subway network is sensitive to passenger tolerability coefficient, and reliability is greater during non-peak hours than during peak hours. In addition, the stations that are important to the connectivity reliability of the Wuhan subway have two features, i.e., they are located at the center of the city, and they are important for connecting subgraphs of the network. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Improving the efficiency and resilience of air transportation is one of the major challenges in the 21st century. Large cities are often in the catchment area of multiple airports. Accordingly, the services at these airports can be comple-mentary or competitive; an airport-specific view of resilience neglects the effects of such interactions. In this study, we analyze the resilience of cities in the presence of airport disruptions. The major research question we address is: How much would the air accessibility of complete cities lose under the outage of a single airport? We perform a study at the global level, comparing the resilience of 5000 largest cities. Two types of passenger-focused measures are proposed to quantify the impact of airport disruption on the air accessibility of cities: The unaffected passengers and the reroutable passengers. We find that some countries have resilient cities, while others are more vulnerable to air-port disruptions. Our study contributes to the literature by a unique combination of city-view, accurate airport-to-city aggregation with road driving distance, and presence of real passenger data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In public transport disruptions, a key relation between the services of operating company and passengers’ satisfaction is the disseminated information. This paper proposes rigorous mathematical descriptions to describe the effects of information availability to passengers, including the user equilibrium and non-equilibrium solutions. The information availability in disruption is summarised in a “who-when-where-what” four-dimensional framework. Based on different information, passengers’ behaviours are assumed and simulated to evaluate the benefits of information availability in public transport disruption. An agent-based micro-simulation model (MATSim) is applied for the city of Zürich, Switzerland, for the benefit of activity-based simulation in a multi-modal network. We use an existing day-to-day replanning method, and extend the study with a within-day replanning approach in MATSim, to study agents’ route choices responding to public transport disruption in one single iteration. The disruption is assumed as a rail track blockage between Zürich HB and Zürich Oerlikon via both Zürich Wipkingen and Zürich Hardbrücke. One benchmark of agents’ behaviours without disruption and other three scenarios based on different information are simulated. Statistic results are analysed for all the agents who may be involved in the defined disruption. Agents’ flow in related transit routes and transport modes shows their adaptations to the corresponding information availability. Agents’ delays and scores reveal that information significantly impacts agents’ satisfaction in public transport disruption. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={For better airport planning and air traffic management, local airport authority in a multi-airport region (MAR) often needs to consider the impacts of competition and collaboration with nearby airports on its own airport traffic. This paper proposed a dynamic spatial panel regression model to test the regional effects on airports in a MAR. The proposed model is applied to four closely situated airports in the Pearl River Delta region (PRD), China, to analyze their interactions, identify the determining factors, and evaluate the impact of these factors on airport capacity. PRD is one of the most prosperous areas in Asia, and competition among the four airports has intensified, due, in part, to the rapid growth of Guangzhou airport and Shenzhen airport. Together with the fact that Hong Kong airport reached 98% of its runway capacity in 2016, it is of great interest to understand the interactions among the airports in this region. The findings show that airport degree, flight frequency, airport capacity utilization, income, population, GDP, and fuel price are significant factors affecting airport's capacity. Furthermore, there is a spatially lagged effect in income and population, and a time-lagged effect in airport capacity, GDP, and fuel price. © 2019},

abstract={This paper examines the bus rapid transit (BRT) legacies of mega sporting events (MSEs) held in the Global South cities of Cape Town and Rio de Janeiro. It discusses the extent to which these transport systems have been operationally sustainable, post-MSE; in other words, their ability to be maintained at a certain rate or level and hence their ability to act as public good as planned and according to specific needs. It argues that in both cities, long-term operational challenges have emerged due to conflictual temporalities between the priorities of the MSE and the mid/long term requirements of a transport system, supplemented by a poor spatial contextualisation of BRT design. These include financial viability, providing a service with appropriate frequency and capacity, integration with other transport systems, and resilience to external shocks such as extreme weather. These findings have key academic and policy implications both by opening further areas of research towards MSEs as a tool to deliver sustainable urban transport, and provides important lessons for future MSE hosts and cities considering BRT. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Strategic disinvestment involves a conscious reallocation of funds to prioritize transportation infrastructure assets in terms of their importance or criticality, and then deliberately shifting limited resources away from lower priority assets toward higher priority assets. While previous investment paradigms considered the economic implications of expanding or maintaining assets versus the alternative of no expansion or no maintenance, disinvestment considers whether it is realistic to attempt to maintain all assets according to their original standards, or if performance standards should be changed or ownership transferred. While the concept of disinvestment has received attention in recent years, there is no established framework for disinvestment actions, potential travel impacts associated with disinvestment actions have not been widely examined, and it is unclear how disinvestment may affect socially vulnerable populations. In this paper, we present a novel framework to guide disinvestment decisions. The framework identifies different disinvestment actions and illustrates the savings, costs, and control tradeoffs associated with those actions. Each action offers different cost-savings and is associated with varying levels of reduced responsibility or obligation. We next introduce a measure of social vulnerability referred to as the Disinvestment Vulnerability Index (DVI) to help identify socially vulnerable populations impacted by disinvestment. We then propose a methodology for identifying a set of least critical or “non-essential” roadway assets as initial candidates for disinvestment, and introduce an approach for quantifying the potential effect of asset-specific disinvestment actions on vulnerable populations. The suggested approach allows decision-makers to “take the first step” in selecting an initial set of potential disinvestment candidates by identifying assets that have a minimal disruptive effect on network-wide travel, while simultaneously considering accessibility and mobility issues related to socially vulnerable populations. We illustrate the approach in the state of Vermont using the state's travel demand model and data obtained from the U.S. Census. © 2019},

abstract={Accessibility is a fundamental aspect for cities and a good degree of connection among different urban areas can be reached by smoothing the travel experience, through the efficient use of public and private transport modes. On the whole, a variety of methods has been developed for measuring accessibility, based on different kinds of dataset and using various types of metrics and indices. In this paper, accessibility is analysed focusing on travel times, as perceived by travellers, the measured travel distances and the average speed, derived from these two attributes, to connect various areas of the city. The methodology developed in the paper is tested on a real dataset for the city of Turin (Italy). This comes to be a proper test site through the availability of citizens' mobility data collected through a travel diary survey proposed in three waves in 2016 and 2017. Such dataset provides useful information to measure the accessibility of different areas of the city. In this way, it is possible to measure how the zones of a city are differently connected, with a strong dependence on the available transport modes and their quality. Results are compared using both active and passive accessibility indicators, to assess the difference between travellers' perception and the scheduled service for the public transport network. The evaluation proposed can provide useful information to estimate the accessibility at city level and map the zones for their ranking assessment. © 2020 The Author(s).},

abstract={In recent years, studies on network vulnerability have grown rapidly in the fields of transportation and complex networks. Even though these two fields seem to be closely related, the overall structure is still unclear. In this study, in order to add clarity comprehensively and objectively, a citation network consisting of the vulnerability studies in the two fields is analyzed. Publication records are collected from the Web of Science and a citation network with 1,181 nodes and 4,601 links is constructed. Then the giant weakly connected component with 705 nodes and 4,584 links is extracted and analyzed. By performing a community detection algorithm, seven communities representing different research domains are identified. Then the major research development in each research domain is revealed by main path analysis. Finally we quantitatively reveal the asymmetric citation patterns between transportation and complex networks, which implies that mutual understanding between two fields is currently lacking. Since these two fields deal with vulnerability of networked systems in common, more active interdisciplinary studies should have a great potential to advance both fields. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={The dependence of coastal communities on marine transportation can challenge a region’s capability to withstand large disruptions, especially in regions susceptible to large natural hazards. Here, a process is presented to model and simulate marine transport earthquake resilience for coastal communities. The model is created using the Graph Model for Operational Resilience. The approach includes the interdependent relationships of different infrastructure sectors and allows for estimation of recovery timelines following disruption. A case-study application in Southern British Columbia, Canada for freight and public transportation ferry service between mainland Vancouver and Vancouver Island is presented. The disruption scenario used in this case study is a magnitude nine Cascadia subduction zone earthquake. The step-by-step recovery timeline produced by the model can provide stakeholders with a concrete example of how recovery could unfold for their operations. The case-study results indicate that berth infrastructure recovery is often the key limiting factor for terminal recovery. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Resilience is the ability of a system to adapt, persist, and transform as a reaction to threats, which may be external or internal to the system, while vulnerability is the state of being susceptible to harm from exposure to stresses associated with environmental and social change and from the inability to adapt. Based on a study of the threats that can affect urban mobility, we identified a gap regarding the analysis of the levels of resilience and vulnerability in the face of subsidy threats that can severely affect developing countries. This article measures the level of resilience and vulnerability due to the absence of public transport fare subsidies. For this purpose, we developed an approach based on fuzzy logic and applied it in 33 administrative regions (ARs) of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We obtained four matrices of the levels of vulnerability and resilience of each of the regions as an origin and destination. The results show that areas nearest to the downtown region and those with high-capacity transportation available (commuter train and/or subway, systems with many transfer points) are more resilient, while a high level of vulnerability is associated with low income, negative socioeconomic indicators, and the predominance of road transportation to reach jobs. The contribution of this paper is the method applied to analyse the levels of vulnerability and resilience of public transport, which includes a threat that can cause a rupture that impacts routines and job accessibility in a region. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={In Mediterranean climate areas, wildfires are one of the most critical problems bringing about several negative impacts (loss of human life, infrastructure damages, landscape transformation, natural environment deterioration, etc.). Fires pose great dangers not only for rural areas, but also for suburban or even urban areas. The aim of the research is to detect areas vulnerable to wildfire in Attica Region and then to examine the critical factors affecting the risk degree in macro and microscale. In the first step we examine the wider study area, which is close to vulnerable areas in a zone at least 1km wide. This examination includes the factor of vegetation along with other factors such as road network, aspect, slope etc, aiming to detect the exact area vulnerable to fire. The second step focuses on a vulnerable study area individually, for identifying and measuring the factors that affect the risk degree in microscale. The most notable factors are: a) population density, b) connectivity of the road network, c) geometric features of the streets, c) location of fire stations and police departments, d) existence of open spaces, e) parking conditions and f) existence of vulnerable facilities. The wider study area (macroscale) is the Regional Unit of Eastern Attica and the main study area (microscale) is the settlement of Saronida. The findings indicate that several rural and peri-urban areas in Eastern Attica are vulnerable to wildfire. Particularly, crucial issues regarding microscale are the low roadway width values and the inadequate connectivity of the network structure. © 2020, Russian Geographical Society.

abstract={Assessing the resilience and interdependence of civil infrastructure systems in order to provide a resilient community for resident has become a prevalent topic among policy-makers, authorities, and scholars around the world. Despite significant advances in this field, there is still a lack of research regarding comprehension of the actual behavior of civil infrastructures in response to hazards and disasters due to their complexity and hidden interconnectivity. This study utilizes disruption data and a network analysis framework to describe resilience dimensions in two infrastructures and further validate the previously presented model. Following the evaluation of infrastructures and the previous model, interdependency between two lifelines will be discussed. Service disruption data is a valuable resource to confirm various theoretical methods. A case study of lifelines in Bhaktapur, Nepal is presented to show applicability of the network analysis model and service disruption data in evaluating the interdependencies between these two lifelines. The resilient characteristics of water infrastructure and the interdependence to power infrastructure are explained. The contribution of this article is threefold: (i) validation of a novel network approach using disruption information, (ii) analysis of recoverability, sensitivity, and types of disruption patterns, and (iii) comparison of behavior and interdependencies between the infrastructures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The article discusses the possible impact of disasters on functionality of the transport critical infrastructure elements by overcoming their resilience. The aim of the article is to provide an appropriate approach to the resilience measurement through understanding of this close relationship. It was achieved by using combination of (1) a decision-theoretical approach based on Influence Diagrams, which was used as a tool to model functionality disruption level of transportation network elements after disaster impact and (2) the time decomposition of the functionality disruption duration of these elements. Based on this approach, the transportation network element resilience assessment was conducted in form of the transportation element resilience loss. The proposed approach is intended to be applied to the critical infrastructure elements rather than to the transportation network as a whole. © 2020 University of Zilina. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In Australia, where the population is contained mainly in series of widely dispersed centres and towns, separated by very long distances, the case for High-Speed Rail (HSR) has generally been less compelling. Subsequently, this research reviews and assesses the implications and advantages of building an HSR passenger-focused transport network in Australia - in particular for the eastern region, where the majority of the nation's population is concentrated. To support this synopsis, European and other HSR systems are reviewed as a capstone precedent for the purpose of lessons to be learned. Using empirical and factor analyses it was found that, the Australia HSR would subsequently increase the transportation sustainability and performance, via reduction in travelling time together with more regional zone coverage. Ultimately, such improvements would particularly benefit the Australian regional communities via appropriate transit of passengers. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={We review recent studies on transportation network performance under perturbations. Three representative concepts relating to network performance are covered: reliability, vulnerability, and resilience. With an overview of the definitions and the quantitative indices of these three concepts, we analyse and compare their similarities and differences in the context of transportation. These concepts differ from each other in terms of focus, measurement, and application scenario. Numerical examples are conducted to assess these concepts under different perturbation scenarios. The results indicate their rationale in reflecting network performance under perturbations, yet their outputs differ. Moreover, the relationship among the three concepts is intuitively illustrated by the analysis results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper aims to analyse the impacts of climate change to the current and predicted future situations of road transportation in the UK and evaluate the corresponding adaptation plans to cope with them. A conceptual framework of long-term adaptation planning for climate change in road systems is proposed to ensure the resilience and sustainability of road transport systems under various climate risks such as flooding and increased temperature. To do so, an advanced Fuzzy Bayesian Reasoning (FBR) model is first employed to evaluate the climate risks in the UK road transport networks. This modelling approach can tackle the high uncertainty in risk data and thus facilitate the development of the climate adaptation framework and its application in the UK road sector. To examine the feasibility of this model, a nationwide survey is conducted among the stakeholders to analyse the climate risks, in terms of the timeframe of climate threats, the likelihood of occurrence, the severity of consequences, and infrastructure resilience. From the modelling perspective, this work brings novelty by expanding the risk attribute “the severity of consequence” into three sub-attributes including economic loss, damage to the environment, and injuries and/or loss of life. It advances the-state-of-the-art technique in the current relevant literature from a single to multiple tier climate risk modelling structure. Secondly, an Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach is used to prioritise the best adaptation measure(s) by considering both the risk analysis results from the FBR and the implementation costs simultaneously. The main new contributions of this part lie in the rich raw data collected from the real world to provide useful practical insights for achieving road resilience when facing increasing climate risk challenges. During this process, a qualitative analysis of several national reports regarding the impacts posed by climate change, risk assessment and adaptation measures in the UK road sector is conducted for the relevant decision data (i.e. risk and cost). It is also supplemented by an in-depth interview with a senior planner from Highways England. The findings provide road planners and decision makers with useful insights on identification and prioritisation of climate threats as well as selection of cost-effective climate adaptation measures to rationalise adaptation planning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents modeling the resilience of an airline cargo transport network affected by a given (large scale) disruptive event. The airports represent the nodes and the air routes and flights between them the links of the network. Modeling implies synthesizing a methodology consisting of two sets of the analytical models: (a) a generic (existing) analytical model for assessing the resilience of particular airports, routes/links, and the entire network; and (b) the new analytical models of the selected indicators of the network's performance used as the FOMs (Figures-Of-Merit) for assessing the corresponding resilience. These indicators of performance include: (i) the airline flights; (ii) the airline transport work; (iii) the airline profits; (iv) the value of time of transported air cargo shipments; and (v) the inventory cost of air cargo shipments at the network nodes/airports. Such proposed methodology enabling assessment of the resilience of affected network over time, i.e., prior, during, and after the impact of a given disruptive event, has been applied to the real airline cargo network (FedEx Express, U.S.) affected by the large scale disruptive event (extreme snowstorm - the so-called nor'easter) characterized by its duration, intensity, and spatial scale. The results have indicated that the network's resilience has been affected differently regarding the particular indicators of performance as FOMs. It has been the least affected regarding ‘value of time’ and the most regarding ‘inventory cost’ of the air cargo shipments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Having efficient and effective transport infrastructure (e.g. bridges, roads, railways, airways and tunnels) in place is essential for supporting the economic and social well-being of an economy. External disturbances that emerge as a result of climate change, for example, are impacting its performance. Delivering, managing and maintaining transport assets that are resilient and adaptive to changing environmental conditions have become a priority for many governments worldwide. Central to ensuring that transport infrastructure functions at their optimum and is resilient to external changes is performance measurement, as it enables those processes that need to be modified and improved for enhancing the asset's adaptability throughout their lifecycle to be identified. Despite the importance of performance measurement in ensuring the resilience of transport infrastructure, it has received limited attention by governments in their policy making. Therefore, this paper provides a review of the extant literature and proposes a life-cycle resilient performance measurement framework (PMF) within transport context. The developed PMF is robust in comprehensively capturing the underlying perspectives that are significant for: (1) understanding the current state of the resilient level of transport assets; and (2) enabling a higher ability of the assets to adapt to environment-related changes in the future. The implications of the proposed framework for transport policy development are also discussed in this paper. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Traditional emergency management studies have made resource allocation decisions to serve the current emergency without knowing which future emergency will be occurring. Different ordered combinations of emergencies result in different performance outcomes. Even though future events can be anticipated, previous studies follow an assumption that events over a time interval are independent. This study follows an assumption that events are interdependent, because speed reduction and rubbernecking due to an initial incident provoke secondary incidents on freeways and the resource availability depends on service times of each request. The misconception that secondary incidents are not common has resulted in overlooking a look-ahead concept. This study is the pioneer in relaxing the structural assumptions of independency during the assignment of servers and approaching the challenge from an operational perspective, online optimization. The main objective is to minimize the time needed to respond to a sequence of requests. We introduce online dispatching strategies with visualization applied in different network sizes, number of requests, and service times to provide insights on model behavior and solution quality. The experimental evidence indicates that the algorithm works well in practice. We envision a new era in which an optimal resource allocation adapts to external events effectively and anticipates the future learning from the past to produce effective solutions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to analyze the spatiotemporal vulnerability of a railway system with heterogeneous train flows. The spatiotemporal vulnerability is assessed by the passengers’ delay associated with the dynamic state of the railway system under a disruption, whose structure consists of a physical layer and a service layer. The physical layer is used to characterize the railway system's post-disruption state, including damaged components and their damage occurrence time and duration; while the service layer is used to capture time-related attributes of trains and passengers to estimate the passengers’ delay. Based on these two layers, the spatiotemporal vulnerability of the railway system can be investigated for different disruptions. This study applies the proposed framework to Chinese Railway System and analyzes its spatiotemporal vulnerability under two types of disruptions: the individual station failure and the spatially localized failure. The findings of this study facilitate better design of system maintenance strategies and help mitigate system spatiotemporal vulnerability under various disruptions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Transit systems are complex open systems susceptible to service disruptions due to a variety of operational and infrastructure failures. Demand-side transit user reactions form an important part of system resilience. This study proposes Affective Events Theory (AET) to understand transit users’ frustration and behavioral reaction to service disruptions. The behavioral reactions are structured in accordance with Hirschman's Exit-Voice-Loyalty framework. While service disruptions can cause passenger frustration, the behavioral response varies from complaints (voiced) to avoiding transit use on the next trip (exit), and continue as usual (loyalty). The collected data is a representative sample of 1629 transit users from Innsbruck (Austria). Exploratory factor analysis followed by an estimation of a structural equation model served to validate the model framework. Better network coverage, service quality, and personnel behavior mitigate the frustration of transit users upon event occurence. Higher transit user frustration is related to a higher frequency of service disruptions. Higher frustration is related to more complaints (voiced). However, the tendency to complain is associated with lower, reduced transit use on the next trip (exit), meaning that voice and exit substitute each other. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper presents a synthesis of the state-of-the-art on transportation network resilience. The socio-technical approach associated with resilience evaluation is broad and multidisciplinary, focusing on the network’s ability to sustain functionality and recover speedily after disruptions. The three key problem areas identified in literature were: minimal network-level study applications of resilience; insufficient practical methods in quantifying the recovery phase of resilience; and the need for the development of resilience indexes demonstrated on real-life regional network models. The authors of this paper recommend that: further investigative efforts are directed towards the post-disaster phases of resilience; evaluating the applicability of resilience indexes on multiple hazard events for transportation networks is requisite; and the formulation of resilience indexes based on regional network models and variable demand traffic assignment models. Furthermore, collaborative efforts between management authorities and researchers are necessary to facilitate the advancement and enactment of necessary policies to enhance transportation systems’ resilience. © 2018, © 2018 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies Limited.},

abstract={The main purpose of this article was to develop a method of researching accessibility in the event of a flood through the application of measurement based on mobility. In the course of the research, it has been proven that changes in mobility (and the related travel speed) are too significant to be ignored when studying accessibility in unusual circumstances. The vast majority of existing accessibility studies rely primarily on speed models, which - in the event of a flood - do not indicate the external effects of the natural disaster. On the basis of the conducted research it has been stated that the occurrence of a flood has a significant impact on changes in the spatial distribution of traffic and its related speeds. Such changes vary depending on the particular means of transport. With the most commonly applied methods of measuring accessibility, which are customarily based on speed models, the changes we observed would not be recorded. The application of mobility-based research in the analyses of accessibility - especially in the event of a flood - indicates the disaster's influence on the capacity of the road network, and thus, it allows for more effective flood-risk management. Furthermore, this article also demonstrates the possibility of applying source materials available in most member states of the EU, i.e., flood-risk maps and digital terrain models (NMPT), for the purposes of analysing and identifying road section closures within the transport network after the occurrence of a flood. © 2019 by the authors.

abstract={The concept of intrinsic vulnerability of a traffic network is defined for the first time in this paper. Intrinsic vulnerability is the susceptibility to incidents characterised by a probability of occurrence in space and time of difficult estimation, which can result in considerable reduction or loss of the system functionality. Given the nature of this type of vulnerability, its assessment might arise as a major problem. Therefore, this paper investigates the assessment of the intrinsic vulnerability of a traffic network through a set of quantifiable indicators, i.e., accessibility and reliability. Moreover, it is of interest to determine whether the selected indicators are sufficient to assess the intrinsic vulnerability or if there is any significant missing aspect to be considered. A new methodology based on structured elicitation of multivariate uncertainty from experts is presented to address these issues, allowing the estimation of the intrinsic vulnerability and its probabilistic relationship with the indicators accessibility and reliability. Although applied to the case of the metric intrinsic vulnerability, the proposed methodology emerges as an effective tool to understand other traffic descriptors of difficult evaluation such as resilience. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The public transport system (PTS) consists of different types of transport subsystems, such as high-speed rail (HSR), air transport (AT), conventional railway, expressway and waterway in a state, which exerts significant impacts on distribution of demographic and economic activities. And its interruption or failure may cause severe social and economic disruption. So the vulnerability analysis of the system attracts an increasing attention. However, most of previous researches mainly concentrate on the vulnerability modeling and analyzing of a single subsystem, neglecting the simultaneous interruption of components, and less considering the complementary effects of other subsystems from systematic perspective and the geographic interdependency among components. For trying to fill these gaps, this paper proposes a method to analyze the vulnerability of PTS composed of two or more transport subsystems and identity the critical area within the system based on the data of running timetable and position coordinates. Finally, taking HSR and AT coupling system in mainland China as a case study, we investigate the differences of vulnerability and critical areas between individual subsystem and overall system. Results reveal that the vulnerability variations and the critical areas distribution of the system are different from these of the subsystems. The research also finds that whether a component is critical depends not only on the system's feature, but also on the component's feature, whether an area is critical depends on economic development and population density of the area. These findings are beneficial to prioritize the plan, budget and maintenance of PTS, and prepare emergency response plans. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Identification of critical components in transportation networks is an essential part of designing robust and resilient systems. Topological criticality measures are based on graph theory and are applicable in multiple domains including communication and social networks. However, the non-linearity of link performance functions in transportation systems does not allow a perfect domain transfer of topological measures. Hence, transportation researchers take traffic flow characteristics into account while developing criticality measures. In such approaches, typically, a network performance measure is selected, then links are removed one-by-one, and traffic demand is reassigned to the updated network to calculate the impacts of each link failure. This consecutive link removal procedure requires multiple assignments which create a computational burden, especially for large networks. Overall objectives of this paper are (1) to compare and contrast selected criticality measures, and (2) to develop a new measure to identify critical components of transportation network, considering both traffic characteristics and network topology. For this purpose, the user equilibrium traffic assignment formulation is utilized, and the convex combinations solution algorithm is exploited for identification of link criticality ranking within a single traffic assignment. The developed measure is named Link Criticality Index (LCI). The LCI is compared with the existing measures in the literature through three numerical examples. Pros and cons of the LCI and selected measures are discussed in detail. The results indicate the proposed link criticality measure provides a balanced ranking with respect to connectivity/redundancy as well as the traffic conditions in the network. © 2019},

abstract={Consideration of climate change in environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a rather novel topic, which became partly mandatory through the revised EU Directive on EIA. Through a mixed-methods approach involving key-actors from EIA practice, decision making and climate adaptation planning, this study presents a transdisciplinary point of view on barriers and opportunities to tackle climate change adaptation in the environmental assessment of large-scale projects. It is based on both a retrospective ex-post evaluation of existing practices in Austria and Germany as well as prescriptive examination and development of outcomes for practice through the development of a climate-fit toolkit that supports the incorporation of climate change impacts into EIAs. The scenario analysis applied with a backcasting approach provided the opportunity to look beyond limitations related to legal compliance and partly lack of data identified by previous research. Three scenario narratives were elaborated based on nine key impact factors based on literature review, content analysis of EIA documents and interviews with EIA actors. The groups of actors carried out a prioritization of actions towards consideration of climate change in EIA. Finally, the actors were involved in co-production of an online tool-kit for Austrian and German EIA practice. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={It is rather difficult for the stakeholders to understand and implement the resilience concept and principles in the infrastructure asset management paradigm, as it demands quality data, holistic information integration and competent data analytics capabilities to identify infrastructure vulnerabilities, evaluate and predict infrastructure adaptabilities to different hazards, as well as to make damage restoration and resilience improvement strategies and plans. To meet the stakeholder's urgent needs, this paper proposes an information elicitation and analytical framework for resilient infrastructure asset management. The framework is devised by leveraging the best practices and processes of integrated infrastructure asset management and resilience management in the literature, synergizing the common elements and critical concepts of the two paradigms, ingesting the state-of-the-art interconnected infrastructure systems resilience analytical approaches, and eliciting expert judgments to iteratively improve the derived framework. To facilitate the stakeholders in implementing the framework, two use case studies are given in this paper, depicting the detailed workflow for information integration and resilience analytics in infrastructure asset management. The derived framework is expected to provide an operational basis to the quantitative resilience management of civil infrastructure assets, which could also be used to enhance community resilience. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Air transport network (ATN) is always described as an unweighted and independent network when assessing its resilience in previous literatures. However, the complementary effects (CE) of high-speed rail network (HSRN) on ATN becomes more and more obvious. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method to assess the resilience of ATN by taking it as a time-weighted network which is complemented by HSRN. Furthermore, via a case study of ATN in China, we find the complementary effects of HSRN and its different level can exert dramatic influence on ATN resilience. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Road network vulnerability analysis is helpful in the improvement of vulnerable links with proper maintenance investments and management strategies. This paper addresses issues that have received limited attention in past studies: estimation of travel demand after link disruption and analysis of accessibility variation. An activity-based model was used to estimate travel demand changes due to link closure, and link importance was evaluated using a set of vulnerability indicators. Accessibility changes induced by link closure are presented and discussed. Vulnerability analysis was conducted for the road network of the municipality of Dolo in northern Italy. Considering the spatial distribution of activities and trips, the results obtained with the activity-based model were more reliable than those obtained with the fixed demand model, which makes the unrealistic assumption of unchanged travel demand after network degradation. These findings are relevant for appropriate resource allocation strategies, which depend on correct link vulnerability analysis and ranking. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={This work studies urban road traffic networks and discusses potential ways to assess the criticality of urban links and nodes. A series of indicators are defined that are useful to evaluate spatial and temporal features and facilitate the identification of congestion hot spots. One way to achieve this is by utilizing concepts from graph theory (e.g. connectivity, efficiency, betweenness). These indicators are based on the structure of the network (graph) and do not require any traffic data. On the other hand, one could utilize historical traffic data (e.g. flows, densities, average speeds) in order to evaluate the importance of an urban link (or node) to the overall performance of the network. Such an analysis could capture congestion dynamics, spill-backs, and queues propagation in the network. Here, we combine both approaches mentioned above to come up with a classification (or ordering) of the different links and nodes inside an urban zone. This classification can then be used for real-Time traffic control purposes, e.g. a city can choose the intersections that need to be instrumented and thus reduce the operational cost of online traffic management. Finally, we discuss the correlations between the different indicators and how one could take this into account in the decision making process. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={To enhance the transport network's residence to natural hazards, it is necessary to understand who the key decision makers are and how they interact. To enhance understanding of this, we used the opportunity provided by the North Canterbury earthquake and its impact on freight to engage with those involved in the preparedness, response and recovery of the transportation network. We piloted an adapted systems-based methodology as an engagement tool for use with key actors with the aim of demonstrating a new way to reveal insights that contribute to enhancing transport network resilience in New Zealand. The tool was developed iteratively and was able to rapidly obtain, capture and analyse the state of the network post-event after adaptations to its structure. Indicative findings indicate the absence of a post-event lessons learned mechanism and a lack of clarity around the position and connections with local government are two areas that could be improved to enhance resilience. © 2019 World Conference on Transport Research Society},

abstract={This paper investigates the factors affecting air passengers’ transfer airport choice in the market between Southeast Asia (SE Asia) and North America (NA). By estimating demand parameters, the study sheds lights on an airport operator's business strategies, including identifying effective routes to compete for transfer passengers. Specifically, a discrete choice model is applied to estimate air travelers’ utility function from choosing different transfer airports in an origin-destination market. Our dataset consists of 78 city-pairs in the SE Asia–NA market. Instrument variables are used to control for potential endogeneity of airfare, while airport characteristics including minimum connection time (MCT), service quality, size, and detour degree are treated as exogenous. The main empirical findings are: (1) Transfer passengers’ airport choice is determined by an airport's characteristics including MCT and service quality of flight connection, in addition to the traditional factors such as airfares and travel time. (2) Based on the estimated utility function parameters, we quantify transfer passengers’ willingness-to-pay for several characteristics of the transfer airport. (3) With our estimation results, a case study is conducted for Incheon International Airport to identify candidate routes that have the greatest potential for the airport to increase the number of transfer passengers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Urban climate risks have a wide range of impacts on the health of more than 50% of the world’s population, which is a critical issue relating to climate change. To support urban climate study and categorise different urban environments and their atmospheric impacts in a consistent way, the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification scheme has been developed. The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools project aims to map the LCZ of cities across the globe. However, previous classification approaches based on satellite images have limitations regarding the characterisation of three-dimensional features such as building heights. This study aims to apply convolutional neural networks to classify LCZ types based on ground-level images, which can provide more detail of the urban environments. Validation results have shown an overall accuracy of 69.6%. The new method outperformed previous satellite-based studies for classifying the LCZ types Compact Mid-rise, Sparsely Built, Heavy Industry, and Bare Rock or Paved. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={The Malacca Strait, the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal play an important role in the global container shipping. To study the impact of main channel interruption on the container shipping, we analysed statistical data on all routes operated by the top 100 global container liner companies and constructed a network model. We selected four topological metrics to measure the network’s connectivity and used the network weekly total shipping capacity and average shortest shipping time to measure the network’s transportation capacity and transportation time. The interruption of the main channel is simulated, and the changes in the metrics are analysed. The results indicated that the network’s vulnerability is sensitive to main channel interruption. If the Malacca Strait is interrupted, the network’s prosperity degree fall by almost half and the network’s transportation time increase by more than a quarter if the Suez Canal is interrupted. In addition, East Asian and European container liner shipping have more than 50% dependence on the Malacca Strait and the Suez Canal. Moreover, the container transport time between ports in East Asia, Europe, and North America and the rest of the world increases by an average of 4–9 days in the main channel interruption. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={This paper focuses on the resilience of rail freight operations when affected by extreme weather events. Such events, most likely linked to climate change, are becoming more common and it is vital to mitigate their effects on freight transport activity. Based on a British case study of rail network disruption resulting from a key line closure in early-2016, the analysis considers the impacts on rail freight service provision and the wider supply chains. Following a review of the relevant literature, the case study is analysed using data from a combination of sources including an annual rail freight database, open access real-time train running data, observation surveys and stakeholder interviews. This reveals widespread consequences of the disruption, with fewer freight trains operated than normal, and longer and less punctual journeys for those which ran. However, despite the considerable disruption during the period of the line closure itself, there has been no discernible long-term impact on the rail freight flows which were impacted by the closure. The insight provided by the analysis is used to make a series of recommendations to the rail industry and policy makers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Railway infrastructure already has some 'smart' characteristics, in that it 'knows' where trains are located and can sometimes detect track and other equipment faults. There is considerable scope to increase these capabilities. There is also a significant and urgent need for such improvements: railways have limited operational flexibility and face increasing passenger and freight traffic demand on existing infrastructure. The reliable provision of additional capacity requires improved system 'self-knowledge' for traffic control and management purposes, as well as for system reliability and safety. The use of smart infrastructure for fault prediction and the guidance of preventive maintenance helps to maintain operational capacity. This approach also helps to reduce track access requirements for traditional maintenance and renewals activities, thus increasing network availability and total capacity. Climate change presents the railway industry with significant challenges, notably in terms of flooding and earthworks failures resulting from increased rainfall intensity. Smart infrastructure includes the prediction and monitoring of such events to maintain safety and enable the timely implementation of operational contingency plans. This paper draws upon a range of sources to identify the needs for and potential benefits of increased deployment of smart infrastructure and other assets on railways in Britain and elsewhere. © 2017 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.},

abstract={Government departments have limited resources but they are responsible for the healthy functioning of whole markets. This tension is amplified by the opportunities to generate, share and use information from new data sources and digital technologies. Huge increases in volumes and types of data produced by sensors and firms' IT systems can potentially be shared between firms which can cause information overload. This paper uses government orchestration theory to investigate the problems and opportunities of the UK's maritime transport ministry as it supports resilience planning for the whole country's ports system. We build on the developing Lean Government (l- Government) literature by theorizing on the differences between government and other stakeholders. We use a case study to investigate how these differences hinder as well as support the role of a government department. And how the special perspective of an orchestrator can integrate and filter information, motivate diverse collaborators and support the use of orchestration platforms in l-Government. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The role of transportation is becoming ever more important as cities are spatially expanded along with urban development, yet highly agglomerated by complex activities over their geographic territory. Flooding incidents in cities across the world have exposed the vulnerability of transport networks which can result in significant, lasting disruption. This appears to be overlooked in emerging-coastal cities, especially prone to flooding as plans for transport development, are ultimately driven by economic drivers resulting in uncontrolled urbanisation. By using a combined method of hydrological flood modeling and GIS analysis, this paper demonstrates the increasing vulnerability of the transport system in Ho Chi Minh City based on current plans for transport development. The paper highlights the need to consider a new approach to transport planning and advocates the application of a Resilient Transport System (RTS) which can be integrated into potential revisions of city master plans to help Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) shift from resistance to resilience to extreme floods. The focal point of the concept is the spatial transfer of transport flows based on a pre-organised structural and flexible transport system constituted by links, nodes and relevant services in terms of different levels of elevation and locations. The intrinsic value of its application to the transport plan is that a city can retain a certain capacity (probably on a smaller scale) of its transport system in order to mitigate potential impacts on urban activities resulting from flood disruptions. © 2018 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies},

abstract={The availability of wireless networks and the pervasive use of mobile ICT devices have allowed passengers to conduct various e-activities during journeys. These various e-activities, in turn, may change people's conventional perception of travel time from being “wasteful” and “unproductive,” to “desirable” and giving rise to satisfaction. Journeys on high-speed railway (HSR) is particularly relevant for transport researchers to probe into this question because of its characteristics of being medium to long-distance (typically taking half-an-hour or more), seat availability, and a smooth ride. Using a questionnaire survey on passengers along the Shanghai-Nanjing HSR route, this study aims to examine the nature of ICT device use and in-vehicle e-activities conducted by HSR passengers and the influence on their travel satisfaction with their on-board journey experience. Our results reveal a high percentage of ICT device use and a wide variety of e-activities such as e-working, e-communication, and e-reading for leisure on HSR trains. In addition, the higher use of ICT device was associated with an increase of passengers' travel satisfaction. Furthermore, we found a positive effect of work-related e-activities on travel satisfaction for business/work trips, while a positive effect of entertainment-related e-activities for non-business/work trips. Given that HSR is potentially a more sustainable transport mode, some possible policy implications are proposed to encourage people to use HSR, as opposed to driving or flying, for medium to long-distance intercity journeys. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel stochastic mathematical framework to investigate the connectivity of road networks impacted by earthquakes. The concepts of “global connectivity” and “local connectivity” are defined and evaluated using percolation theory. Specifically, global connectivity measures the extent to which the whole network is connected, and local connectivity measures the distances between each node to its neighbors. Furthermore, the concept of efficiency is employed to integrate local connectivity. A new percolation process integrating the traditional localized attack and random failure is proposed, which sheds light on the application of percolation theory to practical networks when facing disruptions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Urban rail transit (URT) systems are critical to modern public transportation services. Unfortunately, disruptions in URT systems can lead to dysfunction and threaten sustainable development. This study analyses URT network sustainability from a vulnerability perspective. Two network attack scenarios, including random attacks and intentional attacks, are designed to assess different kinds of disruptions to URT networks. Under random attacks, nodes are randomly removed from the network. In contrast, under intentional attacks, key nodes are identified and removed based on topological metrics and passenger flow volume. Then, URT network vulnerability is evaluated by quantifying the changes in network efficiency and structural integrity under the network attacks from a spatio-temporal point of view. The real-world case of the Shanghai URT system from 1993 to 2020 is used to illustrate the vulnerability in the evolution of the URT system. The results indicate that the URT network is increasingly fault-tolerant and structurally robust over time. The URT network is more vulnerable to intentional attacks than to random failures. Additionally, there are significant spatial differences in the vulnerability of Shanghai URT network. Stations in the central activity zone (CAZ) are more fault-tolerant and robust than stations located outside of the CAZ. Furthermore, stations with large centrality and greater passenger flow volumes and lines with many key nodes and greater passenger flow volumes, are vulnerable to disruptions in the URT networks. This study provides a new index to comprehensively quantify node centrality; it also fills a research gap by analysing the vulnerability of URT networks based on both longitudinal and spatial patterns. Finally, this paper highlights significant practical implications for the sustainable development of URT networks, as well as the sustainable development of public transportation services. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Resilient transportation networks constitute a vital component of urban societies. Even a temporary disruption in the network can paralyze an entire society. Extreme events, such as natural disasters, may have serious destructive impacts on the performance of transportation networks. Reliable performance of transportation systems during an emergency is also critical for a timely, efficient, and successful emergency management operation. Quantitatively analyzing resilience of transportation networks is a critical step toward developing reliable urban societies. Advanced technologies, namely GPS tracking systems, provide rich information about human mobility in urban areas and can be used to monitor traffic patterns. This study proposes a systematic quantitative approach, to develop transportation networks and quantify their topological features using taxi GPS traces. A process control is developed to statistically monitor the topological features of the transportation network through time. Such analysis can allow detection of unusual patterns due to an extreme event and to analyze resilience of the transportation network. This methodology is used to analyze resilience of the New York City transportation network against Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The outcomes of this study will help decision makers analyze resilience of transportation networks, measure and compare destructive impacts of extreme events, and identify vulnerabilities in transportation networks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We proposed a Bayesian network model (BNM) based on function-oriented resilience framework and ontological interdependence among 10 system qualities to probabilistically assess the general resilience of the road transportation system in Beijing from 1997 to 2016. We tested the model with multi-source data collected from various sectors. The system qualities were examined by analysis of sensitivity and influence. The result shows that the general resilience of Beijing's road system exhibits a "V" shape in its trend, with the probability of being generally resilient between 50% and 70%, and at its minimum in 2006. There was a steep increase in such a probability since 2006. In addition, the general resilience of Beijing's road transportation system is most affected by its capabilities: (1) to rebuild its performance; (2) to be robust; (3) to adapt; (4) to change; and (5) to quickly repair damaged parts. The proposed BNM is a promising tool for multi-dimensional and systematic analysis, instead of finding a one-size-fits-all quantification criterion for the resilience. © ASCE.},

abstract={This paper aims to propose a set of indicators to measure the resilience of transportation systems, focusing on urban mobility. For this, a systematic literature review was carry out and, from this, a bibliometric analysis was conducted revealing the influence of the ecological, community and economic domains of resilience on the transportation field. This allowed the identification of the main resilience indicators used by the academic literature in transportation area. Therefore, a framework of indicators, based on resilience properties, was proposed considering that indicators reviewed here can be employed more objectively and consistently. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={In terms of urban rail transit network vulnerability, most studies have focused on the network topology characteristics and travel cost changes after network incidents and analyzed rail transit network independently. The neglects of passenger flow distributions on the network and alternative public transport modes under rail network disruptions would either underestimate or overestimate the vulnerability of rail transit network, and thus lead to inaccurate results and decisions. This study presents an accessibility-based measurement for urban rail transit network vulnerability analysis and explicitly accounts for rail passenger flow characteristics, travel cost changes, and alternative transit modes. It is shown that the proposed approach is capable of measuring the consequences on rail network, and the advantages of the accessibility method are demonstrated and compared. The methodology is applied to the urban rail transit network of Shenzhen, China within a multi-modal public transport network. Results reveal that the consequences of disruptions on network accessibility are obviously different for stations with different passenger flow characteristics, and some undisrupted stations are found to be vulnerable under surrounding station failures. The proposed methodology offers reliable measurements on rail transit network vulnerability and implications for decision-making under rail network disruptions. © 2019 by the authors.},

abstract={Cities need to build on their resilience to deal with the combined effects of urbanization, changing geopolitical contexts, and climate change. The physical form of cities has significant implications for their capacity to deal with adverse events and changing conditions. This paper focuses on streets as major constituent elements of urban form. It offers a review of the theoretical discussions and empirical evidence on how design and configuration of urban streets and street networks can contribute to/detract from urban resilience. For the purpose of this study, measures related to urban streets are divided into two broad categories: network topology and design and orientation. Network topology is used to represent urban street network as a combination of nodes and links. Relationships between urban resilience and different centrality and connectivity measures related to network topology are discussed. The design and orientation category explores the possible effects of street width, street edges, street canyon geometry, and street layout and orientation on resilience of cities. It is discussed that all topology and design measures have implications for urban resilience. Appropriate physical form of urban streets can contribute to urban resilience by, among other things, ameliorating urban microclimate, reducing energy consumption and its associated Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, enhancing social capital, improving community health and well-being, and facilitating rapid and effective emergency response in the aftermath of disasters. Overall, results provide insights about physical properties that are required to design resilient streets and street networks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In this study, we focus on resilience as the ability of specific infrastructure systems at the regional scale to absorb the shocks of extreme events, such as earthquakes. The occurrence of a disaster such as an earthquake leads to a rapid decrease in infrastructure performance. In the case of road networks, performance might refer to the number of drivers using the road within a certain period of time. The objective of this study is to propose a quantitative evaluation method to analyze road network performance (or performance loss) when natural disasters occur. Furthermore, we use cluster analysis and consider the performance loss and asset value in an attempt to propose a method to determine the critical path that should be prioritized for maintenance. This study aimed at analyzing hazard resilience from the network aspect through a scenario analysis depending on damage recovery after disaster occurrence. This study compared the hazard resilience speed to recover existing performance according to the scenario for damage recovery targeting the selected road network. It was found that the total increase in the utility (e.g., total travel time saved) gradually diminished as the restoration cost increased. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper examines the optimal location and allocation of relief trains (RTs) to enhance the resilience level of the rail network. Unlike probabilistic approaches, the priority of demand is handled by link exposure measure which considers the operational attributes of links and accessibility to road system. We formulate the proposed model using a bi-objective programming and solve it using an augmented e-constraint method (AUGMECON) combined with a fuzzy-logic approach. The proposed framework is employed to a real-world case study, and analytical results reveal the superiority of the proposed model in providing an economical and effective layout compared to conventional maximal covering model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={When a disaster strikes many roads are blocked and the affected network may break up into a number of isolated parts. The reconnection of the network is therefore necessary for both relief distribution and planning of construction work. Shortening the time during which the road network is separated into isolated parts helps decrease indirect losses from disasters. The obstacles usually faced during the process of reconstruction include both the large number of blocked links and extensive affected areas (road networks). A reduction of the network into a much smaller complete graph and metaheuristic based on an ant colony optimization has been introduced to overcome this issue. We demonstrate that, for small networks, the metaheuristic produces the same results as other deterministic algorithms. We further show that the method is still a viable approach for large networks (723 nodes and 974 links, where we artificially blocked 46 links) when the NP-hard nature of this problem began to affect the computational time of the deterministic algorithms. We demonstrate how the various scenarios can be included into the algorithm. We finally introduce a new ranking of feasible solutions which enables the algorithm to minimize the time of reconstructions for all repair units. Reasonable results were obtained after five minutes of computation. There is nevertheless an up-to-38% improvement of the initial solution. The algorithm can also be used for both relief distribution, when no roads were damaged, and for planning of construction work when damaged roads occur. © 2018 The Authors},

abstract={The international financial crisis has affected people’s everyday activities, changing multiple aspects of their daily behavior. In countries deeply affected by the economic recession, the crisis has produced a significant incentive to change transport and mobility habits towards cheaper and affordable modes of transport. The impacts of the crisis have been spatially heterogeneous and socially diverse, and consequently mobility adaptation strategies depend on both territorial and social resilience. The present paper analyzes the main changes of mobility habits that occurred between 2004–2012 in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, covering the end of the era of economic growth, and the advent and unfolding of the economic crisis. The research uses travel survey data to understand how different population groups have adapted their mobility to the crisis, and how core and outer metropolitan areas have shaped the adaptation strategies of their inhabitants. The results show a general trend towards a rationalized use of private modes in favor of an increased use of shorter trips and non-motorized modes, but also show how social factors and urban forms interact to generate significant differences in mobility adaptation strategies. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Resilience has in recent years become an established concept in dynamic systems analysis. It is also increasingly employed in dynamic spatial systems, such as cities. The present paper offers an evidence of resilience of urban systems after an external shock. It pays particular attention to natural disasters affecting a cityʼs system. A typology of different types of disasters and of related damage is presented, from a global perspective on the regional occurrence of such calamities. The cost and recovery potential after an external shock are statistically explored. We find that population size and density are critical parameters for the order of magnitude of disaster damage. The comprehensive approach to urban resilience based on risk assessment, identification and management proposed in this paper helps to depict a feasible urban resilience pattern after an external shock. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Recent years have shown a rising popularity of the concept of resilience—both theoretically and empirically—in complex systems analysis. There is also a rising literature on resilience in the transport and spatial-economic field. The pluriform interpretation of resilience (e.g., engineering vs. ecological resilience) is related to methodological differences (e.g., stability in dynamics vs. evolutionary adaptivity). But in all cases the fundamental question is whether a complex system that is subjected to an external shock is able to recover, and if so, to which extent. The present paper [Based on presentation from cluster 6 (Accessibility) of the Nectar 2015 conference in Ann Arbour, USA.] aims to add a new dimension to resilience analysis in spatial systems, by addressing in particular the relationship between spatial accessibility at a municipality level and the resilience outcomes of the spatial system concerned. It does so by investigating to which extent accessibility of Swedish and Dutch municipalities has mitigated the local shock absorption from the recent economic recession. In our study the shock absorption capacity of municipal accessibility is estimated by analysing the relevant resilience indicators for the period concerned. In this context, conventional resilience indicators based on either multivariate complex data (in particular, the Foster Resilience Capacity Index) or employment data (in particular, the Martin Resilience-Employment Index) are confronted with spatial connectivity data based on local accessibility measures, so that geographical mobility may be regarded as one of the shock-mitigating factors. The empirical analysis is carried out for two countries which have both proven to be rather shock-resistant during the recent economic crisis, viz. Sweden and The Netherlands. Clearly, the geographical structure of these countries forms a sharp mutual contrast, viz. a spatially dispersed economy with a few distinct urban concentrations versus a spatially dense economy with one major metropolitan centre (the Randstad), respectively. Our experiments are carried out for the 290 municipalities in Sweden and 40 COROPs in The Netherlands. Our research findings show relevant and new insights into differences in the local recovery potential in Sweden and The Netherlands. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={This study develops and applies a multimodal computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework to investigate the role of resilience in the economic consequences of transportation system failures. Vulnerability and economic resilience of different modes of transportation infrastructure, including air, road, rail, water and local transit, are assessed using a CGE model that incorporates various resilience tactics including modal substitution, trip conservation, excess capacity, relocation/rerouting, and service recapture. The linkages between accessibility, vulnerability, and resilience are analyzed. The model is applied to the transportation system failures in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina to illustrate its capabilities. The analytical framework, however, has broader applications and can provide insights for resource allocations to enhance emergent responses to unexpected events and to improve resilient design of transportation infrastructure systems. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The growth of a city or a metropolis requires well-functioning transit systems to accommodate the ensuing increase in travel demand. As a result, mass transit networks have to develop and expand from simple to complex topological systems over time to meet this demand. Such an evolution in the networks’ structure entails not only a change in network accessibility, but also a change in the level of network reliability on the part of stations and the entire system as well. Network accessibility and reliability are popular measures that have been widely applied to evaluate the resilience and vulnerability of a spatially networked system. However, the use of a single measure, either accessibility or reliability, provides different results, which demand an integrated measure to evaluate the network’s performance comprehensively. In this paper, we propose a set of integrated measures, named ACCREL (Integrated Accessibility and Reliability indicators) that considers both metrics in combination to evaluate a network’s performance and vulnerability. We apply the new measures for hypothetical mass transit system topologies, and a case study of the metro transit system in Seoul follows, highlighting the dynamics of network performance with four evolutionary stages. The main contribution of this study lies in the results from the experiments, which can be used to inform how transport network planning can be prepared to enhance the network functionality, thereby achieving a well-balanced, accessible, and reliable system. Insights on network vulnerability are also drawn for public transportation planners and spatial decision makers. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The analysis of complex networks has been carried out in different fields using an ample variety of method and concepts. Recently, in the general literature of regional economics, the concepts of resilience, connectivity, vulnerability and criticality have been gaining their momentum. The aim of this paper is to provide an analytical framework, using well-known accessibility indicators, in order to calculate the critical links or road sections of the Spanish high-capacity road network. Our analysis will be based on approximately four hundred sections that will be classified in five different groups according to their criticality degree in the whole network. Our analysis will be complemented with the comparison of the results obtained in five different scenarios, namely the average criticality using the effects on the whole country, Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Pontevedra. Furthermore, the paper will also analyze what kind of intrinsic characteristics of the sections favor or not the links’ criticality using a method based on a classification and regression tree. This analysis is crucial to understand other important concepts that are recently being studied in network and spatial economics, like, for example, resilience and vulnerability. It is concluded that the number of relations or routes, being a trunk or not, the road density and the time to Madrid capital play an important role in the criticality of the roads section in the high capacity road network. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={This paper deals with modelling the dynamic resilience of rail passenger transport networks affected by large-scale disruptive events whose impacts deteriorate the networks’ planned infrastructural, operational, economic, and social-economic performances represented by the selected indicators. The indicators of infrastructural performances refer to the physical and operational conditions of the networks’ lines and stations, and supportive facilities and equipment. Those of the operational performances include transport services scheduled along particular routes, their seating capacity, and corresponding transport work/capacity. The indicators of economic performances include the costs of cancelled and long-delayed transport services imposed on the main actors/stakeholder involved—the rail operator(s) and users/passengers. The indicators of social-economic performances reflect the compromised accessibility and consequent prevention of the user/passenger trips and their contribution to the local/regional/national Gross Domestic Product. Modeling resulted in developing a methodology including two sets of analytical models for: (1) assessing the dynamic resilience of a given rail network, i.e., before, during, and after the impacts of disruptive event(s); and (2) estimation of the indicators of particular performances as the figures-of-merit for assessing the network’s resilience under the given conditions. As such, the methodology could be used for estimating the resilience of different topologies of rail passenger networks affected by past, current, and future disruptive events, the latest according to the “what-if” scenario approach and after introducing the appropriate assumptions. The methodology has been applied to a past case—the Japanese Shinkansen HSR network affected by a large-scale disruptive event—the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11 March 2011. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Flood and flood-related problems have become more rampant all over the world leading to loss of life, infrastructure damage, and epidemics every year. There are evidences in recent years where heavy precipitation events have resulted in severe detrimental floods in India. A number of major cities in India have reported a series of devastating floods in the recent decade. The immediate impact of floods specifically in urban areas is on the transport system. Most of the studies on transport vulnerability consider topographic properties along with supply and demand side of transport system to access the disruption; but less attention is given to the potential impacts of weather extremes on the performance of transportation network. In response to that, this study aims to provide a framework to assess the vulnerability of urban road network due to floods. An integrated framework linking meteorological information, land use functions, and hydrodynamic model with safety speed function is used to relate flood depth to reduction in speed in order to determine road network vulnerability. Two rainfall events with 1-in-10 year and 1-in-100 year return period were simulated for inundation mapping over road network and spatial vulnerability of road network was assessed. A critical map and index is developed to identify affected road length vulnerable to flood. It has been observed that more than 40% of road length across the network becomes immovable for 1-in-100 year rainfall event. Also, there is a significant decrease in average maximum speed in each road category corresponding to its normal. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={China's “Belt and Road” strategy emphasizes the significance of maritime logistics. To ensure the efficiency and safety of landside maritime logistics, this study aims to investigate the strategic investment of players in a port–hinterland container transportation network to enhance network resilience to man-made unconventional emergency events by reducing vulnerability. Given the complexity of the involvement of multiple players and their interacting complementary and competitive business relationships, network game theory is adopted. Results show that the complementary influence Bonacich centrality of players plays a critical role in determining their investment decisions and serves as basis from which useful managerial insights can be derived. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={One of the significant aims of transportation network design and management is to improve the service level of the network and the accessibility of individual trips in a certain period. By adopting a well-defined accessibility measure, this paper studies a new discrete network design problem for metropolitan areas, in which some concepts, including the accessible flow, travel time budget function and principles of user equilibrium and system optimization with travel time budgets, are proposed. Then, two deterministic bi-level programming models are firstly formulated to maximize the network accessible flow. The upper level focuses on choosing the potential links in the pre-specified candidate set, and the lower level assigns all the flows to the super network with principles of user equilibrium or system optimization with travel time budgets. Moreover, to handle uncertain potential demands in reality, the problem of interest is further formulated as two-stage stochastic programming models. To solve these proposed models, efficient heuristic algorithms are designed on the basis of probability search algorithm, Frank–Wolfe algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation method. Finally, two sets of numerical experiments in the Sioux Falls network and San Diego freeway network, are executed to test and analyze the rationality and efficiency of the proposed approaches. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The concept of resilience has recently been investigated from the perspective of several disciplines. This extensive research has produced many approaches to determine the key definitions, linked to both the notion of stability in dynamics (return to the previous equilibrium after a shock) and the idea of adaptivity (absorption of the shock leading to new equilibria). Among the various definitions and measurements which can be found in the literature, the Resilience Capacity Index (RCI) defines a kind of ‘potential resilience’ i.e. the potential ability of a region to recover, or bounce back in the presence of external shocks. However, the RCI should also be tested empirically versus other resilience/vulnerability indicators. Vulnerability denotes a different view on the state of the system in the presence of shocks, i.e. the degree to which a system is susceptible to harm. In the present paper, this concept will be adopted by analysing the dynamics of the unemployment growth rate, and then comparing it to the RCI. The country of interest in this paper is Slovakia. Slovakia is a small country in Central-Eastern Europe and can serve as a good example of an open and export-based economy, subjected to the global crisis. Thus, in the context of the 2007–2008 economic crisis, the RCI in the 79 Slovak districts is examined with respect to their vulnerability in the first period of rising unemployment (2008–2012), as well as in the second period following vulnerability to the economic shock (2012–2014). A clear West-East divide in the resilience capacity can be seen. The more urban and export-oriented districts with high RCI values are shown to be exposed to high vulnerability compared with the rural districts. On the other hand, the small, peripheral districts respond to a lesser extent, or with a delay, to the shock. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Critical national infrastructures, including energy, transport, digital communications, and water, are prone to flood damage. Their geographical extent is a determinant of, and is determined by, patterns of human development, which is often concentrated in floodplains. It is important to understand how infrastructure systems react to large-scale flooding. In this paper, we present an integrated framework for critical infrastructure flood impact assessment. Within this integrated framework, we represent interdependent infrastructure assets through spatial network models. We quantify infrastructure flood impacts in terms of disrupted customers linked directly to flood assets and customers disrupted indirectly due to network effects. The analysis shows how spatial network models inform flood risk management practitioners to identify and compare critical infrastructures risks on flooded and non-flooded land, for prioritising flood protection investments and improve resilience of cities. A case study of the Thames catchment in England is presented, which contains key infrastructure assets and highest population concentrations in United Kingdom. © 2016 The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management (CIWEM) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={This book discusses various transport sustainability issues from the perspective of developing countries, exploring key issues, problems and potential solutions for improving transport sustainability in China. It first reviews the current transport sustainability baselines in the three key dimensions of environmental, economic and social sustainability, via an international comparison encompassing both developed and developing countries in different world regions. Then, with a time frame up to 2030, the study groups 100 major Chinese cities according to their baseline conditions, projected population and economic growth, and common sustainability challenges in passenger transport. A systematic attempt is made to discuss the characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of various emerging sustainable transport strategies, including the metro systems, bus rapid transit, light rail, bicycles (and e-bicycles), electric vehicles and walking. Based on the different city clusters identified, the study then explores the opportunities and constraints of introducing a range of emerging sustainable transport strategies through both statistical analysis and detailed fieldwork. Future directions and challenges are identified based on official documents, onsite observations and interviews with local people. The study concludes with thoughts on sustainable transport in smart cities, the importance of governance, local participation, internal and external city movements, and towards a holistic sustainable transport plan. Unsustainable Transport and Transition in China will be of great interest to scholars interested in carbon emissions, climate change, environmental policy, planning, road safety, sustainability, transportation and urban studies, and is relevant to China and other developing countries. © 2018 Becky P.Y.

abstract={This paper looks at the Occupy Central Movement (OCM) in Hong Kong from an innovative and understudied angle of transport resilience. With the OCM as a shock event, subsequent responses may be conceptualised as having three different phases. Phases One and Two refer to chaos at an adverse event's initial outbreak, and the subsequent state of flux. Phase Three may or may not exist; it sets in when people in the society accept these adaptations as longer-term arrangements. Fragmented data and information about the severe disruptions and ensuing changes of the transport system during and after this shock event have been carefully assembled and systematically analysed in relation to the actions and adaptations made by the Government, the industry and the general public. With increasing urbanisation, all stakeholders, including city governments, the industry and the general public, need to be more prepared for large-scale disruptions caused not just by natural hazards but also human beings. Government actions alone are not sufficient. Speedy and concerted responses of the industry are indispensable in achieving transport resilience. Effective dissemination of information through different channels is critical. Moreover, there needs to be concrete steps towards establishing Key Resilience Performance Indicators for cities, covering both the hardware and software components of a transport system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Disruptions of railway traffic have many reasons. Tree falls onto railway tracks or overhead lines rank among the most common causes of disruptions of a natural origin. 2039 tree-fall events, containing up to 70 individual trees per event, were registered on the Czech railway network between 2012 and 2015. 32% of them were directly caused by 14 weather extremes during which more than 20 concurrent tree-fall events were registered. Moreover, 12 train derailments due to fallen trees were registered on Czech railways within the same period. We combined land use data along railway tracks and data on tree falls. Land use and railway tracks data were obtained from a freely available Open Street Map database. The tree fall hazard was then computed using empirical data, data on land use and a generalized rule of succession. The clustering approach was also applied to focus on localities where tree falls were concentrated regardless of the resulting segment hazard. There were 59 rail track segments (out of 2960) with the highest tree fall hazard and 267 clusters were finally identified. The clusters and the most hazardous railway segments will be among the first in the process of line side vegetation monitoring in order to minimize potential losses from tree fall. The presented method can be widely applicable elsewhere. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Accessibility is a key concept in transport and land use policies, and infrastructure-based measures are one important category of accessibility measures. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the attention paid in both academic literature and policy documents to the robustness of the transport system. However, there is not a mature body of literature on the infrastructure-based accessibility measures expressing this concept. This paper proposes a family of accessibility measures to express the robustness of the transport system. These have in common that they express the number of travel options between a given origin and destination, or to conduct activities. The family of measures is conceptualized by using the multi-state supernetwork approach. With respect to the travel options, we discuss (1) the overlap of travel routes, and (2) the choices of travel modes (e.g. car versus train; multimodal). With respect to the activities, we discuss (1) the choice of OD pairs as opposed to activity-travel patterns, and (2) fixed versus flexible activity locations and fixed versus flexible order of activities. We illustrate the travel options and robustness in a multi-modal transport system between the city centers of the Hague-Rotterdam-Dordrecht corridor (The Netherlands). © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={In the context of the urban agglomeration and the rapid development of rail transit, the planning of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region (BTHR) rail transit 2020 is attracting attention. The BTHR is a natural disaster-prone area and a high-risk area for terrorist attacks; the robustness of the area is critical to the sustainable development of North China. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the vulnerability of the regional planning rail transit network. This paper builds a model of planning regional rail transit in BTHR. A critical node recognition measure is designed according to the connectivity reliability of nodes. The method of Monte Carlo simulation of node connectivity reliability is applied based on link connectivity probability. In addition, a model of detecting multi-measure recognition and detecting Core-Nodes is proposed. Finally, the paper analyzes the impact of multiple attack modes on the network performance from the aspects of network performance within region and transit demand outside the region, and analyzes the vulnerability of the BTHR planning rail transit network. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Transit is vital to the functioning of most major cities in the world today and therefore evaluation of the robustness-capacity to withstand disruptions with minimal impact to the system-of transit networks is essential. In this paper, we study the spatial extent of link disruption impacts in urban public transport networks (PTNs) due to spill-over effects that occur as affected passengers choose alternative routes. Quantifying link criticality in terms of its spatial propagation effects is important for prioritizing robustness measures as well as devising methods to encapsulate disruption spill-over effects. To this end, a new local criticality indicator-spatial criticality-that is based on: (i) the magnitude of relative change in load on other links due to closure of a link and (ii) the topological distance between these other links and the disrupted link is introduced. Further, a stochastic user equilibrium, PTN assignment model is developed. The model explicitly considers the service layer of the PTNs and accounts for on-board crowding and denied boarding at stops to represent passenger spill-over effects. Finally, to demonstrate the proposed indicator and investigate its relationship with conventional, local topological indicators, the urban rail-bound network of Amsterdam is used as a case study. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Transport networks underpin economic activity by enabling the movement of goods and people. During extreme weather events transport infrastructure can be directly or indirectly damaged, posing a threat to human safety, and causing significant disruption and associated economic and social impacts. Flooding, especially as a result of intense precipitation, is the predominant cause of weather-related disruption to the transport sector. Existing approaches to assess the disruptive impact of flooding on road transport fail to capture the interactions between floodwater and the transport system, typically assuming a road is fully operational or fully blocked, which is not supported by observations. In this paper we develop a relationship between depth of standing water and vehicle speed. The function that describes this relationship has been constructed by fitting a curve to video analysis supplemented by a range of quantitative data that has be extracted from existing studies and other safety literature. The proposed relationship is a good fit to the observed data, with an R-squared of 0.95. The significance of this work is that it is simple to incorporate our function into existing transport models to produce better estimates of flood induced delays and we demonstrate this with an example from the 28th June 2012 flood in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. © 2017},

abstract={Light rail transit and bus rapid transit have shown to be efficient and cost-effective in improving public transport systems in cities around the world. As these systems comprise various elements, which can be tailored to any given setting, e.g. pre-board fare-collection, holding strategies and other advanced public transport systems (APTS), the attractiveness of such systems depends heavily on their implementation. In the early planning stage it is advantageous to deploy simple and transparent models to evaluate possible ways of implementation. For this purpose, the present study develops a mesoscopic model which makes it possible to evaluate public transport operations in details, including dwell times, intelligent traffic signal timings and holding strategies while modelling impacts from other traffic using statistical distributional data thereby ensuring simplicity in use and fast computational times. This makes it appropriate for analysing the impacts of improvements to public transport operations, individually or in combination, in early planning stages. The paper presents a joint measure of reliability for such evaluations based on passengers’ perceived travel time by considering headway time regularity and running time variability, i.e. taking into account waiting time and in-vehicle time. The approach was applied on a case study by assessing the effects of implementing segregated infrastructure and APTS elements, individually and in combination. The results showed that the reliability of on-street public transport operations mainly depends on APTS elements, and especially holding strategies, whereas pure infrastructure improvements induced travel time reductions. The results further suggested that synergy effects can be obtained by planning on-street public transport coherently in terms of reduced travel times and increased reliability. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={This paper presents a modified topological vulnerability analysis for the metro network. The flow impacts and the capacity constraint are taken into account in this work. A node-based congestion is considered in the travel time model for the metro network. The logit-based path choice model is adopted to assign the flow in the network. Based on the present approach, the efficiencies of the metro network with either fully or partly damaged stations can be analyzed. The vulnerability of the Beijing metro network was studied based on the present method. The results show that the flow in the network plays an important role in the vulnerability analysis. Topological methods neglecting either the flow or the flow impacts would underestimate the vulnerability of the network. Both the magnitudes and patterns of origin-destination (O-D) demand influence on the assessment of vulnerabilities of the metro network and on the importance ranking of stations. Additionally, in a busy metro network the vulnerability would distinctly relate to the percentage of passengers who continue to choose the metro as a means of transportation after a disaster. On the contrary, such responses of travelers have no significant influence in a free metro network. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Geographical scholarship on transport has been boosted by the emergence of big data and advances in the analysis of complex networks in other disciplines, but these developments are a mixed blessing. They allow transport as object of analysis to exist in new ways and raise the profile of geography in interdisciplinary spaces dominated by physics and complexity science. Yet, they have also brought back concerns over the privileging of generality over particularity. This is because they have once more made acceptable and even normalized a focus on supposedly universal laws that explain the functioning of mobility systems and on space and time independent explanations of hierarchies, inequalities and vulnerabilities in transport systems and patterns. Geographical scholarship on transport should remain open to developments in big data and network science but would benefit from more critical reflexivity on the limitations and the historical and geographical situatedness of big data and on the conceptual shortcomings of network science. Big data and network analysis need to be critiqued and re-appropriated, and examples of how this can be done are starting to emerge. Openness, critique and re-appropriation are especially important in a context where transport geography decentralizes away from its Euro-American core, and the development pathways of transport and mobility in localities beyond that core deserve their own, unique explanations. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Ensuring a minimum operational level of road networks in the presence of unexpected incidents is becoming a hot subject in academic circles as well as industry. To this end, it is important to understand the degree to which each single element of the network contributes to the operation and performance of a network. In other words, a road can become an “Achilles-heel” for the entire network if it is closed due to a simple incident. Such insight of the detrimental loss of the closure of the roads would help us to be more vigilant and prepared. In this study, we develop an index dubbed as Achilles-heel index to quantify detrimental loss of the closure of the respective roads. More precisely, the Achilles-heel index indicates how many drivers are affected by the closure of the respective roads (the number of affected drivers is also called travel demand coverage). To this end, roads with maximum travel demand coverage are sorted as the most critical ones, for which a method—known as “link analysis”—is adopted. In an iterative process, first, a road with highest traffic volume is first labeled as “target link,” and second, a portion of travel demand which is captured by the target link is excluded from travel demand. For the next iteration, the trimmed travel demand is then assigned to the network where all links including the target links run on the initial travel times. The process carries on until all links are labeled. The proposed methodology is applied to a large-sized network of Winnipeg, Canada. The results shed light on also bottleneck points of the network which may warrant provision of additional capacity or parallel roads. © 2017, The Author(s).},

abstract={Infrastructure networks, including transportation, telecommunications, and energy grids, are essential for the correct functioning of many economic and social processes. Considering the import of networked critical infrastructure, it is clear that understanding the characteristics of networks that make them vulnerable to disruption is a valuable endeavor. As recent research demonstrates, network vulnerability is a very relevant issue on the design and operation of any networked process in general, and transportation in particular, where the main interest is on identifying network elements that are singularly sensible to disruptions to their integrity. While there have been some suggestions from the literature that the configuration of the network may influence the vulnerability of individual elements, a systematic investigation of network topology and vulnerability has not been conducted. Furthermore, neither has there been an account of the relevance of coherence in the contents of the network, or in other words, the autocorrelation of flows. Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to investigate, from the perspective of the integrity of nodes, the vulnerability to disruption of individual network elements, while controlling for network topology and autocorrelation. Analysis is based on extensive numerical simulations for different network configurations and spatial autocorrelation levels, and the results obtained demonstrate that the proper evaluation of network vulnerability requires not only an understanding of its topology, but also of the distribution of flows. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper analyzes the vulnerability of the European air transport network to major airport closures from the perspective of the delays imposed to disrupted airline passengers. Using an MIDT dataset on passenger itineraries flown during February 2013, full-day individual closures of the 25 busiest European airports are simulated and disrupted passengers then relocated to minimum-delay itineraries. Aggregate delays are used to rank the criticality of each airport to the network, with the possibility of disaggregating the impact across geographical markets. The results provide useful reference values for the development of policies aimed at improving the resilience of air transport networks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The ability to maintain functionality in transport infrastructure is critical during disruptions. To ensure operational robustness in transportation networks, it is necessary to identify the most vital or critical roads (or links), then reinforce them to increase their resilience. In the literature, conventional approaches to analyze road network robustness have involved efforts to first remove selected road segments (one by one, not collectively), then measure the impact of these changes. Based on these results, the levels of impact are ranked and links that demonstrate the most significant impacts are deemed to be the most critical. One of the most significant limitations of such approaches, however, is that they disregard the combined effect of road connectivity. This study advances the state of knowledge in transportation-based resilience analysis through the development of an approach to assess the impact of “critical combination scenarios”. The methodology involves a two-phase process. The first phase is based on the sensor (loop detector) location problem, within which, a selected number of high demand roads are identified as “candidate” critical links. Then, the second phase employs a series of discrete network design problem (DNDP) to find a variety of critical combination scenarios. The DNDPs are solved based on a system optimal relaxation method using Bender's Decomposition. Building further from these results, the extent to which a road network is robust (or fragile) is analyzed. The results of the DNDP solutions are demonstrated to be similar to a Lorenz Curve in which the area under the Lorenz Curve (in percentage) can be viewed as a global robustness index. This index can be used to compare and assess the robustness of different road networks and mitigation scenarios. To illustrate the practical utility of this method, this research applied the methodology to the Winnipeg, Canada road network. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Decisions get made every day about how to keep New Zealand’s freight moving. They get made about our road, rail, shipping and air infrastructure by people at every level of the transport system, from the politicians deciding the level of funding available, to the infrastructure operator, to the transport user deciding what mode is best to freight goods. As part of the Resilience to Nature’s Challenges research programme on governance and infrastructure, we are using the consequences for freight of the November 2016 North Canterbury earthquakes to examine where decisions are being made so we can better understand barriers and opportunities for resilience in how networks are governed. Piloting an adaptation of Rasmussen’s Actor Maps methodology, this paper describes how a map was drawn of the network of actors and their relationships so that it is possible to see connections between institutions, regions, sectors and transport modes. The map of the system was produced initially from analysis of documents, policies and media reports, and then developed iteratively by talking to a range of subject matter experts. The novel application of the Actor Map methodology in the pilot has been able to shed light on the key player relationships necessary for resilient decision making and where stronger relationships could help. Initial lessons show the need for greater recognition of the multi-level nature of complex systems such as multimodal, inter-regional transport networks to ensure greater effectiveness in response and recovery, as well as preparing for significant disasters. This paper will discuss lessons for New Zealand, and discuss potential approaches to enhance resilience governance of networks. © 2017 ATRF, Commonwealth of Australia. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nowadays detailed Public Transport (PT) data are available thanks to open standards such as the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS), introduced to enable information services usually provided via web. In this paper this dataset has been used, after some conversion and filtering operations, for accessibility analysis, based on some indicators to measure how the zones of a city are well connected, in terms of capacity, number of transit options and their efficiency. The study focuses mainly on the assessment of the consequences of transport resources disruption, considering a large flooding event as risk scenario, which could generate also the closure of bridges and then limit the PT coverage. The selected case study is in Torino (Italy), to measure the impact on the various zones of the city, in terms of variation in their transit service accessibility. Relevant capacity reductions (more than 90%) are observed at the north-east of the city. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={Nepal earthquake, have shown the need for quick response evacuation and assistance routes. Evacuation routes are, mostly, based on the capacities of the roads network. However, in extreme cases, such as earthquakes, roads network infrastructure may adversely affected, and may not supply their required capacities. If for various situations, the potential damage for critical roads can be identify in advance, it is possible to develop an evacuation model, that can be used in various situations to plan the network structure in order to provide fast and safe evacuation. This paper focuses on the development of a model for the design of an optimal evacuation network which simultaneously minimizes construction costs and evacuation time. The model takes into consideration infrastructures vulnerability (as a stochastic function which is dependent on the event location and magnitude), road network, transportation demand and evacuation areas. The paper presents a mathematic model for the presented problem. However, since an optimal solution cannot be found within a reasonable timeframe, a heuristic model is presented as well. The heuristic model is based on evolutionary algorithms, which also provides a mechanism for solving the problem as a stochastic and multi-objective problem © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={In 2004, Medellín, Colombia’s second largest city, implemented the world’s first modern urban aerial cable-car public transport system. The impetus and subsequent history of this initiative are marked, on the one hand, by a commitment to social urbanism and spatial justice, and on the other hand, by neo-liberal elements related to making the city more nationally, regionally and globally more competitive. As a relatively cheap, clean and highly visible response to urban transport problems, it has attracted widespread attention from city authorities throughout Latin America, Europe and Asia. It was followed by major participatory neighbourhood upgrading process, comprising new social housing, schools and other social infrastructure, as well as support to micro-enterprises. The combination of these interventions has helped upgrade some parts of the city’s fabric marked for years by severe poverty and violence. These interventions sought to address the huge spatial inequalities between these neighbourhoods and the rest of the formal city, but have they made Medellín a more resilient and environmentally just city? Through an examination of three principles of social justice-redistribution, reciprocal recognition and political participation-this chapter explores the relationship between resilience and environmental justice as a result of the institutional, socio-economic and political factors implicated in the planning process and impact of the aerial cable-car and related interventions under the rubrique of social urbanism in Medellín. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Natural and man-created disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, accidents and terrorist attacks, require evacuation and assistance routes. Evacuation routes are mostly based on the capacities of the road network. However, in extreme cases, such as earthquakes, road network infrastructure may adversely be affected, and may not supply their required capacities. If for various situations, the potential damage for critical roads can be identified in advance, it is possible to develop an evacuation model, that can be used in various situations. This paper focuses on the development of a model for the design of an optimal evacuation network which simultaneously minimizes retrofit costs of critical links (bridges, tunnels, etc.) and evacuation time. The model considers infrastructures' vulnerability (as a stochastic function which is dependent on the event location and magnitude), road network, transportation demand and evacuation areas. Furthermore, the model evaluates the benefits of managed evacuation (system optimum) when compared to unmanaged evacuation (user equilibrium). The paper presents a mathematic model for the presented problem. However, since an optimal solution cannot be found within a reasonable timeframe, a heuristic model is presented as well. This heuristic model is based on evolutionary algorithms, which also provides a mechanism for solving the problem as a multi-objective stochastic problem. Using a real-world data, the algorithm is evaluated and compared to the unmanaged evacuation conditions. The results clearly demonstrate the advantages of managed evacuation, as the average travel time can be reduced by 5% to 30%. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The current international crisis has had impacts on multiple aspects of everyday life in Spain. As an indispensable support of daily life, mobility has also been affected by the loss of jobs and the fall of spending power of families. The dimension of the changes, however, depends largely on the inherent conditions of the territory, which has the ability to enhance or constrain adaptation strategies to the crisis. The article analyzes daily mobility in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region for the period 2004-2012, examining the evolution of mobility patterns in the years before and after the arrival of the crisis in Spain. The impacts on daily mobility are contextualized upon the territorial resilience of each metropolitan area: Barcelona, the 1st and 2nd metropolitan crowns, also analyzing the different possibilities of adaptation that each area offers its citizens.

abstract={It has been anticipated that climate change impacts ambient air pollution and thereby affects indoor air quality through ventilation. Yet, it is not clear how a changing climate, along with new developed interior building materials, products, and air cleaners, affects indoor air quality, and how to minimize negative effects. In this paper, ozone, as one of the greenhouse gases, has been selected to examine the photochemical mechanism for the explanation of ground level changes in the outdoors. The effects of temperature and precursors on ground level ozone formation have been discussed. Ozone concentration changes for different regions within Canada in recent 20 years are examples to demonstrate the trend of ozone levels in the future. In addition, the indoor sources contributing to the ozone levels are characterized. Moreover, this paper explores the feasibility of photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) technology based air cleaners for indoor ozone removal with the objectives of providing reliable technology and updating the literature. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Vulnerability Analysis for Transportation Networks provides an integrated framework for understanding and addressing how transportation networks across all modes perform when parts of the network fail or are substantially degraded, such as extreme weather events, natural disasters, road crashes, congestion incidents or road repair. The book reviews the range of existing approaches to network vulnerability and identifies the application of each approach, illustrating them with case studies from around the world. The book covers the dimensions of time (hours, days, weeks, months and years), spatial coverage (national networks, regional areas, metropolitan and urbanized areas) and modes (road, urban public transport and national railway systems). It shows how the provided framework can be used to indicate the most suitable accessibility tools and metrics for a particular application. Vulnerability Analysis for Transportation Networks is for academics and researchers in transportation networks and for practicing professionals involved in the planning and management of transportation networks and services.

abstract={Urban metro systems are subject to recurring service disruption for various reasons, such as mechanical or electrical failure, adverse weather, or other accidents. In recent years, studies on metro networks have attracted increasing attention because the consequence of operational accidents is barely affordable. This study proposes to measure the metro network vulnerability from the perspective of line operation by taking the Shanghai metro network as a case study. As opposed to previous studies that focused largely on disruption of important nodes or links, this study investigates the disruption from the line operation perspective. Betweenness centrality (BC) and passenger betweenness centrality (PBC), number of missed trips, weighted average path length, and weighted global efficiency were analyzed considering relative disruption probability of each line. Passenger flow distribution and re-distribution were simulated for different disruption scenarios based on all-or-nothing assignment rule. The results indicate that the metro lines carrying a large number of passengers generally have a significant impact on the network vulnerability. The lines with circular topological form also have a significant influence on passenger flow re-distribution in case of a disruption. The results of this study provide suggestions on metro system administration for potential improvement of the performance of operation, and passengers may meanwhile have an improved alternate plan for their commute trip when a disruption occurs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={As a consequence of the international financial crisis in 2007, the region of Algarve, where tourism plays an important economic and social role, suffered a decrease in tourism demand, while unemployment increased sharply. Although tourism activities registered a quick recovery, unemployment levels continued to grow. This article examines the impacts of tourism activities on the sectorial structure of the regional economy, using a Bayesian vector autoregressive model. The results reveal that tourism growth did not automatically create the expected positive impacts on the economic performance of the other sectors, as was expressed by the objectives defined in the regional development strategies over the last two decades. The positive impacts of tourism were concentrated in the production of non-tradable goods and the construction sector, leading to a significant reduction of the weight of the tradable sector within the regional economy, similar to a process of deindustrialization described as the 'Dutch disease'. The decline of construction activities after 2007 has led to a significant increase of regional unemployment, although tourism growth has returned to 'pre-crisis' levels, revealing the lack of regional resilience. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Network risk assessment takes into consideration the probability that adverse events occur and the impacts of such disruptions on network functionality. In the context of transport networks, most studies have focused on vulnerability, the reduction in performance indicators given that a disruption occurs. This study presents and applies a method to explicitly account for exposure in identifying and evaluating link criticality in public transport networks. The proposed method is compared with conventional measures that lack exposure information. A criticality assessment is performed by accounting for the probability of a certain event occurring and the corresponding welfare loss. The methodology was applied for a multi-modal public transport network in the Netherlands where data concerning disruptions was available. The results expose the role of exposure in determining link criticality and overall network vulnerability. The findings demonstrate that disregarding exposure risks prioritizing links with high passenger volumes over links with a higher failure probability that are significantly more critical to network performance. The inclusion of exposure allows performing a risk analysis and has consequences on assessing mitigation measures and investment priorities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={High temperatures and heat waves can cause numerous problems for railway infrastructure, such as track buckling, sagging of overhead lines, and the failure of electrical equipment. Without adaptation, these problems are set to increase in a future warmer climate. This study used industry fault data to examine the temporal and spatial distribution of heat-related incidents in southeast England and produce a unique evidence base of the impact of temperature on the rail network. In particular, the analysis explored the concept of failure harvesting, whereby the infrastructure system becomes increasingly resilient to temperature over the course of the summer season (April-September) as the most vulnerable assets fail with each incremental rise in temperature. The analysis supports the hypothesis and clearly shows that a greater number of heatrelated incidents occur in the early/midsummer season before reducing significantly, despite equivalently high temperatures. This failure harvesting and the consequential increased resilience of the railway infrastructure system over the course of the summer season could permit an innovative and dynamic new approach to heat risk management on the railway network. New approaches that would reduce the disruption and delays and improve service are explored here. © 2016 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract={Accessibility is a key concept in the field of transport geography. There is a rich, though not very mature, body of literature on this topic which is largely application-driven. The focus in the literature is generally on methods and concept and/or on applications. Applications generally focus on ex ante or ex post evaluations of the implications for accessibility of (candidate) policy plans. An important question is which are the main challenges in the area of accessibility research? This paper aims to examine this question and provide a research agenda for the coming one or two decades or so. The focus is on putting relatively new topics on the agenda, rather than making suggestions for improvements of given accessibility indicators. The paper does not aim to provide a complete list, but rather proposes avenues for future research focusing on (1) indicators to express accessibility, and (2) evaluation. In the area of indicators the challenges include the impact of ICT on accessibility; the inclusion of the robustness of the transport system in indicators; comparing perceptions of accessibility and traditional accessibility indicators; the option value; and the indicators of accessibility for goods transport, air transport, and slow modes. In the area of evaluation the paper discusses the pros and cons of the logsum as an accessibility measure, ethical aspects, comparisons of accessibility indicators to evaluate a specific case, and the needs of the clients of accessibility research. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Future climate change is likely to increase the frequency of coastal storms and floods, with major consequences for coastal transport infrastructure. This paper assesses the extent to which projected sea-level rise is likely to impact upon the functioning of the Dawlish to Teignmouth stretch of the London to Penzance railway line, in England. Using a semi-empirical modelling approach, we identify a relationship between sea-level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years and then use model-based sea-level predictions to extrapolate this relationship into the future. We find that days with line restrictions (DLRs) look set to increase by up to 1170%, to as many as 84-120 per year, by 2100 in a high sea-level rise scenario (0.55-0.81 m). Increased costs to the railway industry deriving from maintenance and line restrictions will be small (£ millions) in comparison with damage caused by individual extreme events (£10s of millions), while the costs of diversion of the railway are higher still (£100s of millions to billions). Socio-economic costs to the region are likely to be significant although they are more difficult to estimate accurately. Finally, we explain how our methodology is applicable to vulnerable coastal transport infrastructure worldwide. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={This paper suggests a flexible decision support framework for the strategic planning of a freight transport hub network in Greece. The proposed methodology treats practical aspects related to the optimal number, location and geographical covering of hubs, through the network analysis of interregional trade, based on original survey data for road freight flows during 2004-2012. The results offer insights into the hierarchical structure of the network and related investment priorities, as the hub role of a prefecture is found to be strongly influenced by high population densities and manufacturing specialization, and its location along highway corridors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Past research shows that a better understanding of reliability and identification of ways to improve it can help a system's response to a disaster, leading to increased transportation system resilience. This study focuses on the quantification of improved reliability, which reduces the time of annealing and recovery post uncertain disruption. A reliability model is presented by using three performance functions that estimate the total travel time, flow, and consumer surplus. Network reliability is estimated by considering uncertainties in link-capacity and demand sensitivity with respect to travel time, following a disaster. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are conducted to identify the most crucial links in the transportation network, for which resistance should be increased to mitigate disaster risk. The simulation results show that the model provides accurate predictions of the system performance, and that a reliability model that accounts for uncertainty yields better results than a deterministic (no uncertainty) model.

abstract={The many varied views on resilience indicate that it is an important concept which has significance in many disciplines, from ecology to psychology to risk/disaster management. Therefore, it is important to be able to quantifiably measure the resilience of systems, and thus be able to make decisions on how the resilience of the system can be improved. In this paper we will work with the definition, due to Pimm (1991), that resilience is "how fast a variable that has been displaced from equilibrium returns to it." We will think of a system as being more or less resilient depending on the speed with which a system recovers from disruptive events or shocks. Here we consider systems which revert to an equilibrium state from shocks, and introduce a measure of resilience by providing a quantification of the rapidity of these systems' recovery from shocks.We use a mean-reverting stochastic model to study the diffusive effects of shocks and we apply this model to the case of the London Underground. As a shock diffuses through the network, the human-flow in the network recovers from the shock. The speed with which the passenger counts return to normal is an indicator of how quickly the line is able to recover from the shock and thereafter resume normal operations. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={This study proposes a framework to explore the concepts of exposure, vulnerability and connectivity in EU road network and to assess the potential transportation infrastructure sensitivities towards Sea-Level Rise (SLR) and storm surges. The magnitude and significance of impacts were determined and knowledge of network robustness was built up based on existing climate data and on future trends. Various spatial databases were integrated and a four-stage transport model was used to explore the likely impacts of network degradation. The pattern of the network was assessed via both node- and link-based measurements, where different road databases, namely TRANS-TOOLS and Tele Atlas/TomTom, were employed in order to analyze the impact of spatial resolution within network connectivity analyses. This general framework developed for European Union, was tested on a specific and articulated case study area; namely, the north-east coastal region of Spain. The research conducted, yielded useful methods for the analysis of network vulnerability, where impacts are more significant in regional accessibility patterns. Accessibility indicators at the regional level changed drastically, with some regions showing up to a 26% decrease. According to the results of network connectivity indicators, the changes in network topology have reduced the number of alternative routes and placed more pressure on the transport system. The implementation of this framework and quantitative assessment methodologies outlined in this paper could be employed to assist policy makers to recognize the opportunities that may arise or diminish the adverse effects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The transport system is critical to the welfare of modern societies. This article provides an overview of recent research on vulnerability and resilience of transport systems. Definitions of vulnerability and resilience are formulated and discussed together with related concepts. In the increasing and extensive literature of transport vulnerability studies, two distinct traditions are identified. One tradition with roots in graph theory studies the vulnerability of transport networks based on their topological properties. The other tradition also represents the demand and supply side of the transport systems to allow for a more complete assessment of the consequences of disruptions or disasters for the users and society. The merits and drawbacks of the approaches are discussed. The concept of resilience offers a broader socio-technical perspective on the transport system's capacity to maintain or quickly recover its function after a disruption or a disaster. The transport resilience literature is less abundant, especially concerning the post-disaster phases of response and recovery. The research on transport system vulnerability and resilience is now a mature field with a developed methodology and a large amount of research findings with large potential practical usefulness. The authors argue that more cross-disciplinary collaborations between authorities, operators and researchers would be desirable to transform this knowledge into practical strategies to strengthen the resilience of the transport system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={This paper aims to adopt a critical stance on the relevance and interpretation of the recently emerging concepts of resilience and vulnerability in transportation studies. It makes a clear distinction between engineering and ecological interpretations of these concepts and offers a systematic typology of various studies in this field. A core element in the study is the linkage between the aforementioned concepts and connectivity/accessibility in transport networks. The methodological findings in the study are put in perspective by addressing also such concepts as robustness, reliability and friability of transport systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The abstract representation of a transportation system as a network of nodes and interconnecting links, whether that system involves roadways, railways, sea links, airspace, or intermodal combinations, defines a network topology. Among the most common in the context of transportation systems are the grid, ring, hub-and-spoke, complete, scale-free and small-world networks. This paper investigates the role of network topology, and the topology's characteristics, in a transportation system's ability to cope with disaster. Specifically, the paper hypothesizes that the topological attributes of a transportation system significantly affect its resilience to disaster events. Resilience accounts for not only the innate ability of the system to absorb externally induced changes, but also cost-effective and efficient, adaptive actions that can be taken to preserve or restore performance post-event. Comprehensive and systematically designed numerical experiments were conducted on 17 network structures with some relation to transportation system layout. Resilience of these network structures in terms of throughput, connectivity or compactness was quantified. Resilience is considered with and without the benefits of preparedness and recovery actions. The impact of component-level damage on system resilience is also investigated. A comprehensive, systematic analysis of results from these experiments provides a basis for the characterization of highly resilient network topologies and conversely identification of network attributes that might lead to poorly performing systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The assessment of the potential impact of climate change on transport is an area of research very much in its infancy, and one that requires input from a multitude of disciplines including geography, engineering and technology, meteorology, climatology and futures studies. This paper investigates the current state of the art for assessments on urban surface transport, where rising populations and increasing dependence on efficient and reliable mobility have increased the importance placed on resilience to weather. The standard structure of climate change impact assessment (CIA) requires understanding in three important areas: how weather currently affects infrastructure and operations; how climate change may alter the frequency and magnitude of these impacts; and how concurrent technological and socio-economic development may shape the transport network of the future, either ameliorating or exacerbating the effects of climate change. The extent to which the requisite knowledge exists for a successful CIA is observed to decrease from the former to the latter. This paper traces a number of developments in the extrapolation of physical and behavioural relationships on to future climates, including a broad move away from previous deterministic methods and towards probabilistic projections which make use of a much broader range of climate change model output, giving a better representation of the uncertainty involved. Studies increasingly demand spatially and temporally downscaled climate projections that can represent realistic sub-daily fluctuations in weather that transport systems are sensitive to. It is recommended that future climate change impact assessments should focus on several key areas, including better representation of sub-daily extremes in climate tools, and recreation of realistic spatially coherent weather. Greater use of the increasing amounts of data created and captured by ‘intelligent infrastructure’ and ‘smart cities’ is also needed to develop behavioural and physical models of the response of transport to weather and to develop a better understanding of how stakeholders respond to probabilistic climate change impact projections. © The Author(s) 2014.},
